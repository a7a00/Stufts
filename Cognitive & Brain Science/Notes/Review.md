# Review

Not entirely sure what we're doing, but we're supposed to be having a test. Lesson instead.

## *Mememnto*

Not entirely sure what the hell happened in this movie, and the lecture on it is making less sense.

Before we move on, I am seriously creeping out the girl behind me. Not sure why. Maybe it's the MLP wallpaper.

## Exam Review

Heavily abbreviated because I already wrote this shizznit:

### Object Recognition

* Temporal lobe is the "what" pathway
* As we go deeper, cells fire in response to more and more specific things (e.g. FFA)
* Receptive fields get larger, and are subject to input from the parietal lobe ("where" pathway)
* Temporal lobe cells will restrict their regions of interest when only small areas are relevant.

### Mental Images

* Propositional content (E.g. Decent memory for photos a year later)
* Spatial content
  * Kosslyn's island map (longer reaction times for greater distance)
  * Mental rotation (longer reaction times to greater degree of rotation)
  * Longer reaction times correlate with increased blood flow in parietal lobe
  * Spatial deficits show up in mental images too
  * Spatial neglect patients neglect the lefthand side of their *mental* images, as well as physical
* Visual content
  * Color blind people have color blind images
  * Temporal lobe damage leads to poor color/shape imagery
  * Occipital lobe activation when doing mental imagery (conjuring up from the brain, not the eyes)
* Motor content
  * When holding an object, mental rotation gets harder
  * When you rotate bodies instead of objects, mental rotation get easier, inless the bodies are all weirdly contorted.

### Memory

#### Iconic

The Sperling rows of letters study showed you can direct attention to any region of space (any row of letters) after it's gone in order to do pattern recognition (recognize the letters) only for ~250 msec, then the memory is gone.

#### Symbolic and Perceptual

* Santa's remember shapes vs. names of shapes study showed that shapes easier when they're in the same visual display; names of shapes easier when they're put in linear display.
* Perceptual memory is like mental imagery (we've already talked about that)
* In symbolic memory, information gets chunked
  * Chunks are units (you must access the whole thing)
  * Sternberg's search study showed that you always search through all the numbers in the list, even if the right answer was only halfway through.
  * Chunks are front anchored (you must start at the beginning)
  * Klahr's alphabet study showed that it's easier to remember the next letter in the alphabet if you're in the middle of a chunk and don't have to jump.

#### Short-Term (Working)

* Not a storage bin with 7 Â± 2 items
* Vallar & Baddeley's list memorization study showed that we can remember more 1 syllable words than 2 syllable words, and it's not directly proportionate to items, but how quickly we can read through them.
* Working memory is a system for keeping informati on active (that's why we call it "working memory" now), using a central executive with two slave systems: one for perceptual memory (visuospatial sketchpad) and one for symbolic information (phonological loop).
* Rehearsal keeps things active in working memory, but barely gets anything into long term memory (Glenberg's "napkin napkin napkin" study)
* Deep processing gets most information into long term memory.
  * Hyde and Jenkins, Craik and Tulving, showed that rating pleasantness of words, or seeing if they fit into sentences, makes us remember them better than scanning them for capital letters or other structural information
  * *Trying* to remember doesn't help us much.
* Deeper processing means more interconnectivity with other information (Kolers' upside down reading study showed that connections with past upside down (or otherwise strange) reading experiences helps us remember
* Short term memory's capacity is defined by chunks
  * Ericson, Chase & Faloon's digit span study and de Groot and Chase & Simon's chess studies
  * Experts create new chunks and associations between chunks (these are adjustments to their long term memory)
  * Chunks are made by using mnemonics to give groups of units new meaning (e.g. grouping letters into words, or chess pieces into tactical groupings.

#### Long-Term

##### Semantic Memory

* Abstraction Theories: semantic memory is a set of definitional features (like an encyclopedia entry) that we've abstracted away from our actual experiences.
  * Brewer & Treyens' office study demonstrated cases of categorical amnesia (fruit, musical instruments), schemas and scripts
  * The memory system has lots of generalizations in place.
  * Collins and Quillian TLC semantic memory model shows a hierarchical organization of semantic memory, everything is stored as efficiently as possible. ("Cana ry has skin" takes longer to confirm than "Canary sings")
* Instance-Based Theories: semantic memory is just a bunch of episodic memories of our actual experiences stacked on top of each other so that certain features (the most common ones) seem more prevalent.
  * Conrad's typicality study shows that "Cow gives milk" is faster to confirm than "Cow has hooves".
  * Labov's bowl/cup study, Wittgenstein's "game" thought experiment show that concepts have fuzzy boundaries and can't be defined with features.
  * Rosch & Mervis' prototype theory
    * Concepts come from accruing central features (e.g. having feathers) over all our experiences with a member of a concept category (e.g. birds)
    * The more central features an item has, the better an example of that category it is
* Dual Theories: aspects of both Abstraction and Instance-Based Theories
  * Armstrong, Gleitman & Gleitman
    * Instance based Theories will never succeed, because we need to be able to think logically about our concepts (red hair vs. red apple; pet fish)
    * We must have abstractions for thinking logically about concepts, *and* prototypes for thinking quickly about concepts.
  * Anderson's ACT model
    * Same hierarchy as Collins and Quillian, but relying on connectionist mechanisms
    * Spreading activation is doing the work
    * Spreading activation isn't ideal; it spreads willy-nilly (so you get the fan effect, which slows you down) and it runs out (so you might not access the info you want)
    * Things that experience tells us go together more (e.g. cows and milk) have stronger associations (more heavily weighted connections)
  * Everybody now agrees that semantic memory gets built based on our episodic memory
    * This explains state-dependent learning (e.g. SCUBA study, marijuana study, Kolers' upside-down reading study), because context (episodic memory) gets associated with content (semantic memory).
    * This also helps explain childhood amnesia (must use episodic memory to build some semantic memory structure and expectations before new info can attach)

##### Episodic Memory

* Neisser's Pearl Harbor realization, Schmolck et al.'s OJ Simpson study, the large-scale 9/11 study show that episodic memories can be inaccurate, even when vivid.
* Roedegger & McDermott's word list study, Loftus et al. and Ceci et al.'s studies planting memories via siblings, photos, or adults speaking to children show that memories can be created.
* Morgan et al.'s survival school study show that memories can be overwritten.

##### Procedural Memory

* Distinct from declarative (semantic and episodic) memory
* Milner's H.M. study and Cohen & Squire's Korsakoff's study show that anterograde amnesiacs have procedural memory without declarative memory.
* Knowlton et al.'s perceptual learning study show that Parkinson's patients have declarative memory without procedural memory.
* Jacoby's dual task memory study shows that even in typical individuals:
  * There's better performance on declarative memory (remembering words) with deeper processing
  * There's better performance on procedural memory (recognizing words flashed really fast) with more perceptual exposure to the word (i.e. seeing it presented onscreen)
* Procedural and Declarative Memory systems are distinct due to the fundamental difference between perceptual and symbolic memory.
