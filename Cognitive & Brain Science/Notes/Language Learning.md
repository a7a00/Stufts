# Language Learning

Test review is always great for wasting a ton of time! Let's get started?

So we know that language one of the most complex kinds of gognition we do. This is a program that knows a ton of symbols, from sounds to words to phrases, knows a ton of rules and exceptions, and one that is capable of considering all these inut steams in parallel to arrive at our best interpretation. And this makes language one of the best things to study to figure out how cognition works, which is why we've been studying it all term. Perhaps the most amazing part of this is that this program automatically sets itself up in the first few years of life, with no coaching whatsoever! And this is why one of the most fundamental questions we have is how language develops and takes shape.

## Vocabulary

Last week, we talked about grammar. Let's talk about the other main component of language, vocabulay. How do we learn to separate a word out from the continuous speech we hear? And how do we then identify these words? We know a few benchmarks are pretty much common:

* **6 months** - Babies make a few familiar words, and frequently babble words with no clear meaning, but with definite conversation intent. (We think that this babbling is speech practice.)
* **9-12 months** - First evidence of systematic word learning and tying sound to meanings and objects. (We test this by asking babies to look at specific images out of sets. You did very well on these much earlier than expected! Good for you!)
* **1-1.5** - Gradual learning of words of a variety of types, from object names ("light") to social greetings ("uh"). Usually you use around 50 words at this point. (You used fucking *five* and your parents thought you were retarded.)
* **1.5-2** - Two changes:
  * A massive surge in vocabulary. 
  * Children put words together into basic phrases.
  * If you're a little shit, you don't express any of this as *speech*, scaring your poor parents into hiring a fucking speech therapist who makes you say words that sound vaguely like "truck". But I digress...
* **2.5-6** - Vocabulary learning surges to 3.6 words per day.
* **6-8** - 6.6 words per day.
* **8-10** - 12.1 words per day.

### Fast Mapping

The explosion around ages 1.5-2 can be traced to a thing called *fast mapping*, where children only have to hear a word once to memorize it. Obviously, we don't retain this ability, so how is this happening? We do retain some of it, though; and that's because identifying an unknown word is made of 2 not so simple problems: First and foremost, what part of the world are we looking at when the word is said?

### Gaze Detection

People tend to look at the things they're naming. By 9 months, infants follow other people's gaze and pointing, and this seems to be an innate trait. In the 1950's Baldwin conducted an experiment in which a child looked at one unfamiliar object while a researcher looked at another and named it. There were 2 very interesting results. The second an unfamiliar word was said, every infant turned to look at where the researcher was looking. This is true even if the researcher was staring at blank space! This proves that gaze detection is sufficiently advanced at 18 months. A subsequent experiment involved researchers naming one object and then pulling another out of a box. The infants chose the one the researchers looked at first, rather than the one they interacted with first, again suggesting that gaze detection is one of the first and most prevalent ways of naming objects.

Lastly, an experiment by Tomasello showed that even if we mis-name the object, infants can pick up if we made a mistake and readjusted our gaze! This means that not only are 1 year olds able to tell where we lookesd, they can name things based off where they think we *meant* to look! That's a pretty huge logical leap, mastered in only a year! Children are scarily good at figuring out intent. Young children can use direction of gaze and pointing to relate a speaker's words to the things they're pointing at, and are even able to make complex inferences to determine intention. How they do this is still an open question.

Regardless, gaze detection solves the first problem of figuring out the what part of the world we're looking at.

### Word Learning Assumptions

The next problem. *What* exactly are we talking about? Say I look at Big Lobs and say "lobster". Do I mean:

* The basic concept of a lobster?
* Big Lobs? (The lobster's proper name)
* The concept of a stuffed animal?
* The subordinate concept of a *plush* lobster?
* The superordinate concept of an animal/arthropod/living thing?
* Big Lobs' role/job/location?
* Big Lobs' temporary state? (Watching TV, being abused on the daily, etc.)
* Big Lobs' claw/tail?
* The concept of a Game of Thrones/Silicon Valley marathon?

All of these have their own words, and if you didn't know what "lobster" meant? Hell, don't get us started on homophones, or things like "lunch" and "dinner", where the same thing has different words at different times. There are potentially hundreds of meanings for a new word, even if we're pointing at one thing. For children to learn words, there obviously have to be constraints on their interpretation of the things adults mean. And to answer that, we need to look at how adults talk to children when they're reading picture books and whatnot. The results are quite obvious. You say "Look at the lobster!". You never say "Look at the furry thing!", or "Look at the animal!". If you ever do, you always qualify it, i.e. "Look at the lobster! He's so fluffy!".

...People are going to think these notes are so weird.

Anyhow, a psychologist named Markman proposed 3 assumptions he thought infants made:

* The "whole object assumption", the idea that we naturally assume the new word means the *whole object*.
* The taxonomic assumption, the idea that one word refers to all examples of a category. An infant won't assume that a lobster's *name* is "lobster". They'll assume that "lobster" can refer to *any* lobster.
* The mutual exclusivity assumption, the idea that objects generally only have one name. ("Look, a flu! Give me the lobster!" will yield the correct result, even if we don't know what a lobster is.) One label per objet, one object per label.

Again, we're not entirely sure why this happens. But whatever happens, these assumptions that both the adults and children make are vital for conveying meaning.

## Grammar

So knowing to look places where we think people want to look to learn vocabulary is one thing. But how do we learn all of these maddeningly compicated grammar rules? Originally, we thought that kids learned through ridicule/correction. However, in studies, when we either make fun of children or try to correct them, this rarely works. Also, parents almost never do it, and will just roll on with the conversation. Under the old model, this should reinforce mistakes. But somehow, children just magically absorb the rules. Are they hardwired for this? Is there a critical period where children soak up the linguistic input and organize it?

Well, fortunatley, there are 2 language families that are completley seperate from each other, latinate and East Asian. If we take Asians who started learning English at different ages, we can plot when this window closes. Asians who came over around 4 speak English perfectly. Asians who came over around 9 may have an accent or stutter. And Asians who came over around high school will never get over the accent/language difficulties. As an aside, we tested their English proficiency to get these results by having them identify errors speakers of Asian languages commonly make, which leads to some hilariously racist test sentences. (These were actually used.)

* "Man who at market buy two pig."
* "You pay me now."
* "You age when?"

Hehehe... Hirarious. OK, I'm done.

Similar patters emerge with deaf people and ASL, but the deaf also give us a unique insight into how grammar rules come about. In the 1970's Nicaragua recieved a school for the deaf from the UN. Before this, the deaf of Nicaragua had communicated with crude hand signs, with no easy way to learn Spanish. As a result, when the school opened, it had students ages 8 to 80. When all of the deaf were brought together, even though they were being taught Spanish, they started making up their own sign language, and most of these speakers were those past the critical window. Subsequent generations of students, with open critical windows, add enough vocab and grammar to flesh out the language. In addition, newer versions of the language were far better at encoding information quickly and efficiently. Nicaraguan sign language is formally recognized by the UN a few years later, a language that had just organically appeared! Neat, no? We see this organic generation of language arise previously as well. When German and Hebrew speakers in Poland couldn't understand each other, Yiddish developed. Oy.

This means that the critical window is not just a window for finding rules. It's also a critical window for *creating* rules. Your brain doesn't learn English. It *builds* it. The reason we all speak the same language is because we're all getting the same input, but we each build our own local copy. Again, we have no idea how this critical window works. One hypothesis is that the comparative *lack* of frontal lobe activity in the early years makes it much easier to find statistical patterns in the input. This lets you find words and pick up on statistical regularities that adults miss.
