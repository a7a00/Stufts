# Perception and Attention

You have a test next week. Surprise!

So last time, we went over 2 ways to describe cognitive processes:

* The **symbolic approach** says that the mind is a symbolic machine, taking in symbols and manipulating them with rules.
* The **connectionist approach** saus that the mind is a statistical machine, consisting of activation patterns and network collection.

We don't really talk about connectionism anymore, but we do acknowledge that it's a probabalistic system, with information stored in multiple places. Likewise, we get combination of symbols from the symbolic approach, but we need the networking ability to explain things like:

> "What's that word? It means that people don't agree on it?"
> "Yeah, I know it, I just..."
> "No, it's kinda long..."
> "Yeah, I know it, it starts with a C, oh, what the heck is it..."

Remember the key in neural networks. *Memory is in the weights*. We all have similar concepts in our head. It's the way they're connected that creates the different thought patterns and memories we all have. And it's the different experiences we have that write those different patterns. We pretty much all have a "pony" node, but mine is linked to cons and anime, while the girl next to me's is linked to horseback riding. (I assume, at least, she's posting a shit ton of pictures of her and her horse and wearing a Canada Goose jacket and a "new pledge" pin.)

Speaking of the 1%, the majority of learning we do is actually breaking connections in our newborn brains, not making them, leaving only the ones we find useful. Training a neural network is, of course, a matter of manipulating weights in response to which nodes are on and off.

If my notes are looking a bit sparse, it's because we're still doing review 40 minutes into the lesson for some reason. Anyhow, remember, bottom up is symbolic, where only the properties of stimulus guide perception. Top down is connectionist, where higher level representations guide computation of lower level representations. We're close to a Type 1 explanation for bottom-up processing. Top down, not so much.

...Why are we 45 minutes in without starting the lesson?

## Templates and Filters

All right, let's get started! Finally! Remember pattern recognition from last week? When you could find a red bar quickly and a horizontal bar quickly, bt you hat to actually use processing power to find the red horizontal bar? Let's do another experiment!

Quick! Read the blue sentence! As fast as you can!

![](../res/sentences.png)

All right, what did the green sentence say? No peeking!

If you can't figure it out, don't worry, almost nobody can. I told you to quickly grab the blue information, so your brain instinctively knocked out the green. This is known as the *attention template*, and it was proposed by someone named Broadbent. Basically, you only see what you want to see, barring disruptive things like bright lights and loud noises. This is usually subconciously done. For example, Bronx Science students have been conditioned to jump really loudly whenever they hear a certain beep, regardless of volume. Broadbent theorized that we set these templates based on physical properties. ("I'll look over there", "I'll listen to this sound set") There's then something called a filter that removes things deemed unimportant, like the freen words you coundlt read, despite them being perfectly formed and RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. Scary, no? Templates are usually defined as very crude.

* Spatial - Look over there.
* Auditory - Listen to this
* Tempoal - Every 5 seconds, this happens.

After a brief stay in the "sensory cache", short term memory, this info is filtered before it gets to your neural network and is proccessed the way we discussed last week. Filters are slightly more complex, but still rudimentaty:

* Color - Red is usually important and signals a stop
* Shape - Sharp edges grab the eye more
* Pitch & Volume - This is the filter with a baby-shaped hole in it. You're welcome, Mom.

The info then hits your neural network and starts triggering pathways. Broadbent came up with this idea after looking at what were called "dichotic listening tests". Basically, people were made to only pay attention to a message coming in their right ear. Once they were asked about the message coming in their left ear, they could recall:

* If it was speech
* Whether the voice changed
* The sex of the speaker(s)

As you may notice, these are all physical attributes, exactly what we'd expect. They could **not** recall:

* Content
* Grammar
* Languagea

So, no higher processing at all. Exactly what we'd expect.

## Triesman and Attenuation

But, wait! What about the cocktail party effect? This is when you can be fully engrossed in some conversation, tuning out all other sounds. But then when some ass mentions you accross the room, it somehow cuts through the barrier. So, a woman named Triesman modified the test. She swapped 5 seconds of the sample, so that you'd have to jump to the ear you were blocking out for 5 seconds and then jump back. And lo and behold, people switched instinctiveley, without even thinking about it. Of course, the voices stayed the same, so people freaked out after thinking the female voice had become male for 5 seconds. So what does this mean? Well, it means you're not tuning the left ear out! You must discard the data somewhere further up the line! Triesman hypothesized that Broadbent's bottle was not absolute. Lots of info sneaks around it, and it may be badly processed, but it's processed enough for your brain to sound an alarm bell if it sees something urgent, like your own name, or Bronx Science's bell causing you to jump, or the literal split second of MLP at the Super Bowl causing you to do this at the Super Bowl party.

There was a disagreement in the '70s over where exactly this bottleneck was, and there was a really interesting experiment that tried to answer it. People were given headphones and told to press a button whenever they heard an article of clothing. But there was a catch. As the clothing and other junk came in the right ear, junk was coming in the left. When people were told that clothes were coming in the right ear, they always identified the word "socks". When they weren't, they identified it fine when they heard "socks" and "smelly" at the same time. "socks" and "punches"? Not so much. So, when attention is divided, it looks like the neural network is doing some of the filtering, (associating socks with punches instead of clothes) but when attention is directed, it looks like the filtering happens before the neural network is hit.

Anyhow, we seem to only be able to pay attention to some things at once, so we filter things. Lab experiments show that directing attention elsewhere leads to serious decay in our pattern recognition abilities. But this is obviously wrong. We hold onto rich and detailed representations of the world all the time! The room doesn't seem to disappear when you focus on your food or your work or whatever the hell you're doing. So what gives? What are we missing? Much like a shitty clickbait article that will restore your faith in humanity, the answer may surprise you!

## Change Blindness

You've almost certainly herd of the psych experiment where a subject is spoken to by a researcher and then 2 people cut between them with a table or something and the subject doesn't even realize a completley different researcher has been swapped in when the door goes away. This is an example of what's called *change blindness*. Basically, when you're not paying attention to something, you *don't notice it*. At all. It's actually scary. There are exceptions, though, like gender, race and facial hair. So, what does this suggest? We're actually *not* keeping track of details around us at all! It's almost like we're using the visual world as memory for details, and we have to look the details up every time. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; we know the visual world is right there, and eye movements are cheap, so we just look again whenever we need to. And we can use these to build prior expectations! If I glance at you and then move my attention somewhere else, I'll know you still exist there, but I'll need to look back for the details. I rely on the assumption that the world will remain stable. I don't expect things to blip around. I don't expect people to change behind doors. And that's why I assume that things are unchanging, and that's why we can be fooled like this.

## The Stroop Effect

This is a side note, but just as pattern recognition is impossible when attention isn't being paid, it's unavoidable when attention is directed. For example:

# DO NOT READ THIS

Wow, you didn't follow instructions. What's wrong with you? This automatic pattern recognition is also why you fuck up when asked to say the color of the word instead of the actual word. You automatically recognize the pattern and read it. And it takes a bit of time for your brain to suppress that and name the color. Or you just blurt out the word. I don't know what you do. Hell, if you teach people made up words and do this test, you'll very quickly see that they do worse and worse the more they practice and the more they learn the words.

## Attention in the Brain

Let's talk about what your brain is actually doing when you pay attention to stuff. There are 2 pathways we'll discuss:

* Occipital lobe to Parietal lobe - Where?
* Occipital lobe to Temporal lobe - What?

Patients who suffer damage to their Right Parietal lobe (which seems to be more important than the left one) suffer from something called "spatial neglect". Think Kramer when he got hit in the head and only remembered to do things on the right side of his body. Patients just start neglecting the left hand side of their world, eating all the food on only one side of their plate, etc. As a result, patients usually just start moving things to the right side to make life easier.

...Never get strokes. Anyway, they will pay attention to the left side of things if they're reminded of it, and they're perfectly capable of fixing things. THey just forget to. So, why? Well, to answer this question, we can look at the steps of shifting attention.

* Localize
* Disengage
* Move
* Reapply

We can study localization by telling people to look left and waving a flag on the left side of the room. We usually react immediatley, although if the cue lies, there's a small delay. These patients have the same issue. Switch the sides and they're still fine, perfectly capable of flipping attention. But switch the sides and make the cue lie, and they can't find the flag at all. So these victims *can* pay attention anywhere. But there's something about the right side of things that's just so engrossing they can't even notice stuff going on on the left. PET scans confirm that the Right Parietal Lobe is the powerhouse of things.
