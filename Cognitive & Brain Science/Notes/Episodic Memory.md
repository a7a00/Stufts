# Episodic and Procedural Memory

Before we start, the next test will be at home and online once we get back from spring break. Also, sis you know that some people see their memories in first person and others see their memories in 3rd person?

Moving on, we wrapped up abstraction and categorical theories last week, and we'll talk about how these theories are linked together. Remember that our big problem last week was linking the 2 memory paradigms. Well, there's a simple and elegnt solution, and to find it, all we have to do is go back to the neural network. Instead of some magical force that searches through the hierarchy, we should be thinking of the spreading activation we've already talked about. Now, this model has one brilliant component. The more interconnected a piece of information is, the more the activation gets split, and the weaker each activation is. For example, Big Lobs is connected to very few things, which means the path to his mental image always lights up. A word like "college", on the other hand, is connected to so much that each output is weak, and the activation runs out very quickly instead of spreading farther. Remember "the boat ran into the bank" vs "the robber ran into the bank"? There was an experiment carried out to prove this. Subjects hear a sentence like:

> "They're going to watch a movie"

Before the word "watch", we're slow to react to the word "look" or "time" flashing on screen. As the word "watch" shows up, we're quick to react to both. But after the sentence, we only react quickly to "look". This shows that at the instant of activation, we fan out in both directions, before your brain figures out which word was actually intended. This is really cool, but since activation is split, words with multiple possible meanings take a few more milliseconds to process.

One of the really cool things about this is that you don't even notice some nodes firing! Case in point, look at this symbol, and pick which of the 4 choices you think is most appropriate as quickly as you can.

* Kielbasa
* Kimchi
* Currywurst
* Pizza

OK, chances are you picked kimchi and considered currywurst, ditching the other 2. But why? That symbol has nothing to do with food, so how did I know what you were going to pick? Simple. You've seen that symbol before, not enough to remember it, but enough for it to leave some lingering connections in your brain. (Unless you're me, then you know damn well what it is, which is why this demonstration didn't work with me.) That's the symbol of the Worker's Party of Korea, the group that runs the DPRK. You usually see their symbol whenever Kim threatens the US with nukes on TV. But the amazing thing is, your brain makes this subconcious jump from WPK->Kim Jong-Un->Korea->Kimchi *without you even thinking about it*. Neat, huh? (As for currywurst, you were recently in East Germany.)

## Semantic and Episodic

These 2 kinds of memory are *very* difficult to separate. You can't disentangle concepts from your experiences with them. One concept is called "Context Effects", which means we recall prior events better when placed in the same situation again, which is why it's so fucking awful when you have to take a test in a different room than the class was taught in. We tend to tie memories to places. This is confirmed in a hilarious study in 1975 featuring locations such as a lab, a construction site, scuba diving, a spa, and my guess is the provost's office, because there wwas no way the researchers didn't get yelled at for this shit. But something important was proved. If a memory trace includes traces of the location, it's addressable by that trace, which can be triggered by that experience happening again.

Shit, forgot a trigger warning. Must be my straight white cis male privelege.

Another hilarious study proved this with marijuana. Things you remember stoned are better recalled stoned. (But you do worse overall, so don't go using weed as a memory aid.) This also explains why the upside-down sentences from earlier were easier to remember.

### False Memories

Now, look at this list:

* Bed
* Rest
* Awake
* Snooze
* Pillow
* Snore
* Night
* Blanket
* Doze
* Lullaby
* Dream
* Down

You probably know what's going on here, but play along. Remember those words while we go on. There are 2 views of this kind of memory. The first is that anything you put in your head stays there permanantly, even if some information isn't accessible anymore. The other holds that the information is permanantly deleted. Most psychologists follow the first approach, and you should too. Think about how many times you've instantly gotten something back. This is called "spontaneous recovery", and people are still trying to figure out what causes it. Freud thought we were repressing it and tried to bring it back. One of the most common kinds is called a "flashbulb memory". For example, where were you on 9/11? Chances are you know down to the minute, and you were in kindergarten! Plus, you know down to the *second* what happened at BxSci during a certain month. And what happened at that debate tournament in Atlanta. And various other things. (Mom, you can probably use 9/11 pretty well) Research on flashbulb memories started in 1982, when a veteran was talking about how he was listening to a baseball game when he heard about Pearl Harbor. And this was etched in his head. Sounds good, right?

Problem is, you don't play baseball in December. So, what was going on. Why was the flashbulb memory wrong? And this wasn't isolated; people's flashbulb memories change over the course of months and years, and you don't even notice! Within a year or 2, you've locked yourself into this new narrative. Your flashbulb memories warp just like regular memories, with 2 exceptions.

* They warp much slower.
* You are *certain* it hasn't changed one bit.

This is slightly scary.

NOW! Write down as many words from that list as possible! And because you're a smartass who read about this before, (or saw it at JumboDays) you didn't write down "sleep". Well, you were gullible and did at JumboDays/in Unger's class, so let's find out why. 40% of the time, this false memory was created with "high confidence", which means that people would swear it was right.

You can do this in much more sinister ways. Approximatley 25% of adults recall a false memory suggested by a sibling. And with parents, it's even worse. More than 50% of parents will remember embarassing shit about their child that NEVER HAPPENED when another child brings it up. Now, who do we know who would do that to a certain parent. These notes are public, so I ain't saying. And more than 75% of people will believe they did something is you just show them a photoshopped picture of themselves doing it!

Fun fact while we're on break, this is a *very* popular way to arrest people in North Korea and Russia. All you have to do is leave doctored photos of family members out and about, not at home, where those members can see them, implant the false memories, and then come around next week to ask some innocent questions. The overwritten memories erase all alibi and can even incriminate the accused. Not that I'd know anything about how the Iminban arrests enemies of the Korean People, that's ridiculous, how would I know that? Another common technique that secret police from North Korea to Russia to China use is particularly nasty. When a fact is just brought up as a given in a conversation after the fact, such as "Don't mind the phone, think about what else was on the desk", this  will implant a memory, say, of the phone, and the subject will swear that a phone was there! And when you can insert a whole phone, it's very easy to insert things that will prove the subject's guilt of crimes against the Worker's Party. Again, I wouldn't know anything about how secret police overwrite memories to serve their own ends, why on earth would I be privy to that information?

All right, back to class. Unfortunatley, this means that it's almost impossible to tell if repressed memories are real or not. Sorry. We're now moving on to the beginning of...

## Procedural Memory

Now, procedural memoey is not jut motor memory. It's any memory not avaiilable for concious recall. You can't explain it immediatley. For example, how to you ride a bike? You can do it, but you can't explain it. How do you recognize the word "lobster"? How do you recognize the smell of smoke? There are all things that are effortless to do, but hard to explain, and why we use the phrase "you have to try it to know" so much. So, are these memories different from declarative memories? Well, for starters, you need the hippocampus for declarative memories. You can *recall* them without them, but once it's damaged or removed, you can't make any more. But, you can make new *procedural* memories. One famous patient never learned having played a game before, yet he kept getting better and better at it, even without remembering his hours and hours of practice. So, the 2 kinds of memory are obviously seperate, right? We can confirm this with Korsakoff's Syndrome alcoholics, as well, but this is an example of a *single dissociation*. We can show that knocking out the hippocampus gets rid of the ability to write declarative memories, but we don't know if the hippocampus also plays a role in procedural memory creation. So, this isn't good enough. We want a "double dissociation:, where we can compare our population of people who can remember how but not what to a population that remembers what but not how.

Turns out that that population exists, too! People with Parkinsons can remember the past perfectly, but can practice simple tasks for hours and hours and not get any better. There was some stupidly complex probability test that was used to test this that would make *me* punch a wall, let alone someone with Parkinson's. But people without Parkinson's (and our amnesiacs who can still learn how to do stuff!) pick it up right away without even thinking about it, while people with Parkinson's continue to struggle to recognize patterns. So while our amnesiacs are fine with implicit learning but suck at explicit learning, people with Parkinson's are the other way around. Bingo! The 2 systems must be seperate.

We can even demonstrate this with normal people! In 1983, volunteers were asked to do one of three things. Memorize a word, memorize a word and its antonym, or generate an antonym of the shown word and remember that. As you can guess, these 3 tasks take an increasing amount of processing. We then perform 2 tests:

* Did you see the word?
* Here's an unrelated word for 40 milliseconds. See if you can recognize it.

Performance on the first test (explicit) improves with the brainpower of the first task you did, but performance on the second test (implicit) actually *goes down* with brainpower. We're not sure what this means yet, but we can show that these systems are so seperate, they produce directly opposite results. This should be familiar to you from the time we discussed symbolic vs. perceptual memory.

## Childhood Amnesia

This is a very interesting topic to researchers, and it's the basic phenomenon of not remembering anything below around the age of 3. So, what gives? Well, for starters, infants can remember basic lever pressing tasks for several weeks. But, this is procedural memory, and given that we all know how to walk, this amnesia clearly doesn't apply. Is it possible our hippocami just aren't developed enough to remember the what, only the how, until we hit 3? Well, unfortunatley, these infants can't tell us. One study in 1994 showed that children shown a movie before their first birthday reenacted scenes from it before their second birthday, a whole year later, just like adults who did the same thing, except for amnesiacs of course. Since the amnesiacs don't do it, but babies and normal people do, it's obvious that the babies have some sort of declarative/explicit memory.

...I get the strange feeling that I'm the only person in this lecture hall taking notes.

Anyhow, why do we then forget everything before 3? Researchers believe that it isn't just the structure of the brain, just the lack of semantics.
