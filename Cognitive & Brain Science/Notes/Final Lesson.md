# Cognitive Development

OK, no curve on the exam, which kinda sucks, 'cause you got a B+. Oh, well, it's not like there's a final in a few days that can nullify that or anything...

So, on to our final lecture! Last week we talked about how we learn language, but most of the techniques we use seem to magically show up, and we're not entirely sure how. You can't talk about cognitive development without talking about Jean Piaget, the father of child psychology. Before him, people assumed children were essentially similar to us. Piaget began his career working for Alfred Binet, (think the Binet-Simon intelligence scale) but was more interested in *how* children perform intelligence tasks, rather than which ones they can successfully perform. He noticed that children of the same age tended to make the same mistakes and offer the same reasoning for their errors, which gave him the idea that there might be a uniform process that all people follow. Piaget was a hardcore empiricist, saying we're born as a blank slate. He proposes that children are "little scientists", who constantly build and test theories of their world based on the data that's all around them. As we navigate the world around us, we adapt to new information, developing *schema*, concepts about objects, and *scripts*, concepts about actions. When we take in data that matches them, great! If not, we change them to match the data. Take object permanance. We may have a theory that things we don't see simply have disappeared. THat makes sense. But as they keep coming back, we change our rule to match our reality and realize that those objects don't go away.

Our development is split into 4 stages. Ages are literally when the dumbest kids get it.

## Sensory Motor intelligence (0-2)

Everything is confusing as hell. Your brain is still getting acclimated to what the world is, you don't have object permanance or long term memory storage yet, Everything is transient and disconnected; our brains are far too busy figuring out *what* the hell is going on to pay attention to what objects are yet.

We then go through a stage where we understand that objects are a thing, and that they exist when we can't see them. But we're still trying to figure out what exactly objects are. One of the earliest schema we come up with is that location is a fixed attribute. If an object is moved, we don't care, we assume that it will always stay in the same location. It'll take a few examples proving this schema wrong in order for us to revise it.

Once we get objects down, we move on to the next stage.

## Preoperational Intelligence (2-7)

OK, so now we know about object, but we struggle to keep track of multiple dimensions of an object at once. We can't connect multiple objects and actions into one coherent "whole" world, and we're unable to concieve of other perspectives than our own. This lack of understanding multiple attributes explains why we see different shapes as different quantities when we're younger. We can only pay dimension to one dimension (length, width, etc) at a time.

## Concrete Operations (7-11)

At this point, we're able to hold several representations and transform information between dimensions. However, we can still only work with concrete events; we can't form abstractions.

OK, we're back! One of the first criticisms of Piaget's "blank slate" model was the "cliff" experiments. 6 month olds were perfectly willing to crawl off very small drops, (like an inch or so) bu refused to crawl off anything high enough so that they could hurt themselves. By 6 months, completley unaccustomed to drops, 6 month olds somehow had the knowledge to avoid drops preprogrammed. Piaget also argued that to "see" parts of objects obsured by things, or make any sort of complex inference, you had to be at a higher stage. Yet this behavior is exhibited in children as young as 4 months, which means something else has to be going on. We're still approaching the world like scientists and making theories, but something else has to be up.

## Social Cognition

The point at which we say a child "gets it" socially is when they can emulate the thoughts of others, even if that mind is different. I can emulate the thoughts of others and make predictions on what they'll do based on what they, not I, know and think. This shows up early; infants will often turn their heads to look at faces, even after being alive less than a day. This is an innate skill, nothing's been learned yet. By 4 months, children prefer direct gaze. By 6 months, we can already infer goals. (We know that monvements are not constant, but influenced by actors with goals.) By 6 months, we show a preference for helpful characters. By 10 months, we've learned to point.

Things get more sinister from here on out. By a year, we learn to lie and make-belive. It's also around this time that we acknowledge that others might have different goals than us. And by 3, we can take perspectives and understand that seeing leads to knowing. Lastly, by 4, we pass false belief tasks, where we put ourselves in the shoes of others and emulate their thoughts, even if we know they're wrong.

So how do we get from the beginning to the end? Empiricists believe that we solve this piece by piece, slowly figuring things out. Since we each follow a similar process, milestones show up around the same times. We only pass false belief tests when we master embedded sentences, like "I think [wrong thing]." Once we learn to understand this kind of language at age 4, we can pass the false belief tests.
