2 things before we start:

1. I forgot my charger and my battery's shot, so if my battery dies, review the slides [here](../PDFs/memory.pdf).

2. There was a video lecture you should have already seen. Oops. Find it and see it.

Now, let's take a really hard rotation test with our nondominant hands!

...Aaand, my laptop's dead. Check the PowerPoint.
