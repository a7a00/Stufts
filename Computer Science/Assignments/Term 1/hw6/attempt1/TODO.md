During debugging this morning, I sound that something is still wrong with the string search, namely that it gets caught in an infinite loop with some songs. I put one of the offending ones in the test file in the speedtests folder so you can check it out later. The infinite loop happens around index 73 in the search string. No idea what's causing it yet.

As of now, your code lowercases the word, but not the search string. Figure out a way to lowercase the search string and preserve punctuation and grammar for printout. And here's how you're going to do it even though it's a bit hacky. Modify search to comb the song list 3 times, once for "pattern", once for "Pattern", and once for "PATTERN", because those are the only real cases we might see. Preventing duplicates is up to you.
