# ReadMe for COMP 15 HW4
## Binary Search Tree Assignment 

Every assignment you submit you will include a ReadMe file. The name
could be ReadMe, readme, Read-me.txt, readME, ReadMe.md (the “.md”
stands for “markdown,” which allows lightweight formatting) or almost
anything you like that has the word read followed by the word me. Exact
spelling is not important, the contents are.

The purpose of the ReadMe file is the same as the little paper insert
you get in a new appliance -- to give the reader an introduction and
overview of the product.

Your ReadMe file for the assignments **must** include:

1.  The purpose of your program

2.  List of files with one/or two-line summary

3.  How to compile it (saying "use included Makefile" is ok)

4.  Outline of data structure (depending on the assignment)

5.  Outline of algorithm (depending on the assignment)

6.  A list of people who materially helped you on the assignment. If
    you worked with a friend and you shared ideas, you need to 
    list that person, e.g., "Josh Whedon helped me on this assignment".
    You do not need to list TAs, or professors, but you may feel free
    to do so.

The ReadMe file shows the reader, in a quick glance, what the program is
about and gives a general idea of how it works. For short programs the
readme file will be short, for more complicated programs the readme file
will be longer.

Use outline form rather than long discursive paragraphs. A ReadMe file
is an overview.

There is no correct readme format; within these guidelines, devise your
own style.
