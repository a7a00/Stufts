Get desired output

Properly sort your array output

Make code looop

As of now, your code lowercases the word, but not the search string. Figure out a way to lowercase the search string and preserve punctuation and grammar for printout. And here's how you're going to do it even though it's a bit hacky. Modify search to comb the song list 3 times, once for "pattern", once for "Pattern", and once for "PATTERN", because those are the only real cases we might see. Preventing duplicates is up to you.

OKAY, PRIORITY NUMERO UNO, SUPPORT PUNCTUATION BY USING WILDCARD CHARACTERS TO BUTRESS PATTERN INSTEAD OF SPACES. UPDATE ALL CAMPARATORS TO SUPPORT THIS WILDCARD CHARACTERS.
