# The Kyouhou Reforms

## More Figures of the Genroku

### Hishikawa Moronabu & *Ukiyo-E*

This famous printmaker works with Saikaku to illlustrate some work, but also launches the school of *ukiyo-e*, which depicts the "floating world" of the brothel. Tons of *shunga* porn and beautiful ceramics as well.

### Yatsuhashi Kengyou & Chamber Music

This blind *samisen* player became a *koto* player instead, and unvents the concept of chamber music that combines different kind of instrument.

### Seki Takakazu & Mathematics

This scholar makes several achivements in mathematics, coming up with differential and integral calculus around the same time as Newton or Leibniz.

## The Period of Stagnation

A string of short-lived shoguns means that power falls into the hands of the shogunal advisors. Later, in 1716, after Ietsugu fails to produce an heir, power transfers to a different branch of the family, and Tokugawa Yoshimune becomes *shogun*.

### Arai Hakusei

This finance minister inherits a crisis. Following Tsunayoshi's administration, in which Japan had spent wildly and drove up debt, covering it by reducing precious metal content in coins, the economy was on the verge of collapse. Hakusei tries to bring Japan back to the gold standard, and imposes mercantilist policies to curb the flow of precious metals to Korea. In 1715, there's an official reduction in the amount of Chinese and Dutch ships. He also gets the Koreans to acknowledge the *shogun* as King of Japan.

## The Kyohou Reforms

An experienced politician, Yoshimune becomes *shogun* at age 32, and introduces these key reforms. Between 1721 and 1728, the shogunate goes on a spree of sumptuary laws., regulaing Japanese society from top to bottom. Previous edicts are reorganized into a multivolume set for easy reference. The *kabunakama* are recognized, chartered and made mandatory. Everyone has to join. These are then taxed and regulated. This is a smack in the face to neo-Confucianism, which regards commercial activity as suspect. Officials now fix the numbers of members, require a universal ID, require obedience to rules about pay, prices, employment, marketing, festivals, trade secrets, etc. These organizations then fought against outside competition and helped police supply lines and commercial activities. They also helped halt the thread of predatory capitalism and reconcile it wiith the old feudal system.

In 1730, the shogunate officially recognizes (and begins taxing) the Dojima Rice Market. We also have *daimyo* selling their future rice crops directly to brokers and merchants, resulting in a booming Japanese futures market. The old rice futures market still stands in Tokyo, although it has been expanded, and still functions as Japan's stock market, the second largest in the world.

Public education explodes onto the scene during this period. Huge amounts of temples, an emphasis on the study of Confucian tests, and The mass production of the abacus give rise to the beginnng of the Japanese public school system. Literacy among women flourishes, and a great many women become dedacated teachers.

> "[The abacus] has showed us that...only two numbers are truly needed, and that, provided fast enough manipulation, truly incredible feats can be accomplished with the mere two numbers 1 and 2."

Hmmm... Takakazu was onto something.

### *Rangaku*

This is the study of foreign (well, Dutch) science and history. Yoshimune, aggrieved by the Japanese calendar, simply chose to adopt the Dutch calendar instead. As a result, appreciation for Dutch science grows.

> "These red haired men only operate by reckoning and reason; the only use implements they can see, and if a fact is not certain, they neither say so, nor make use of it."

Christianity is still heavily censored, but the field of *rangaku* goes on to produce thinkers who rival Buddhist, Shinto and Confucian scholars.

### Problems

In response to economically crippling famines around the Inland Sea and a fire in Kyoto destroys almost 30,000 looms, riots rack Edo in 1733 and countless houses are sacked. Untold amounts of propetty is destroyed. The response is to increase welfare and establish public granaries, as the *shogun*s are terrified of such an event happening again. It happens again. And again. And again.

In 1736, there's a radical shift in monetary policy. Japan's monetary system was so complicated that people had to train for years and years to simply understand the system. Reform efforts fail to help mend the situation and simply introduce more unneeded regulation.

## Tanuma Okitsugu

Originally a page-boy to Ieshige, an inconsequantial *shogun* from the Period of Stagnation, becomes a member of the *roujuu* in 1772, and catapults to power as a result of the disastorous famine we talked about. Horribly corrupt, he moved the regime toward tax revenue.
