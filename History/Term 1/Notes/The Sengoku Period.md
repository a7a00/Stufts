# The Sengoku Period

This is the period that Japanese society basically goes to hell in a handbasket. Culture remains flourishing, but the country is completley torn apart by near peretual civil war. The Ashikaga period's establishment of a new shogunate and union of the 2 counrts was short lived; after Yoshinori, the 6th Ashikaga shogun is assisinated in the *Kakitsu* affair, his 9 year old son, Yoshikatsu becomes shogun, but he's then thrown from a horse. So sad. From 1443 to 1449, there's no shogun, so real power is devolved to a man named Hosokawa Katsumoto and fighting between the 2 courts resumes. In 1449, the brother of the previous shogun, a 14 year old named Yoshimasa becomes shogun. And during his tenure, there's a realy big fight.

## The *Onin* War

After becoming Shogun, Yoshimasa remains childless until his mid-30's, so he encourages his brother to step down from the Buddhist priesthood on Mt. Hiei. Yoshimasa then has a child, and we can see where this is going. Some of the court support the baby Yoshihisa, others support the brother, Yoshimi. Japanese history indicates that women of the Shogun's court come to blows, and things get steadily nastier until this war breaks out in 1466, this period's first major war.

They key generals of this war are people from court families, the two biggest being Yamana Souzen, fighting for Yoshihisa, and our friend Hosukawa Katsumoto, Souzen's son in law, fighting for Yoshimi, both of whom die in battle.

Fighting happens theoughout the countries, but for the first time, it centers on Kyoto. Most residents and craftsmen flee and much of the city is completley destroyed. Urban warfare becomes common. If there is an upside to this, it's that Kyoto's "hidden traditions" are blown wide open as the artisans spread throughout Japan.

## Higashiyama Culture

Over the course of the war, Yoshimasa calls it quits. and locates himself on the eastern side of the capital, turning over formal power to Yoshihisa (9 years old, great decision making, there) and engaging in cultural pursuits. Yoshimasa builds his famous "silver pavilion"", a quirt and somewhat gloomy residence.

### The Tea Ceremony

In the 1460's, a monk named Murata Shuko introduces a very formalized ceremony for brewing tea, designed to encourage daily focus and disipline. (Although, having done one for 3 HOURS, I can confirm your mind wanders like nothing else.) Nonetheless, it becomes a staple for monks and nobles.

## The *Sengoku Daimyo*

The *Daimyo* of this period have usually started out as military governors of 1 or 2 provinces. As thir power grows, they control huge tracts of land, and by 1570, the Home Islands have been divided among 20 *Daimyo* families. At this time, the *Daimyo* realize that Kyoto is now worthless, and that their underlings are taking power, so these *Shugo Daimyo*  ride home and fail to defend against these new *Sengoku Daimyo*, who field massive modern armies. They also withdraw their samurai from their subjects and base them around large monitored fortresses. (This of course leads to samurai using these castle to backstab their lords. Oops.)  Land for military service remains the golden rule of Japanese culture. They also begin to act like autonomous rulers. They recognize the spiritual authority of the Shogun ruling from Kyoto, but they pretty much ignore him.

### 関所

In defiance of the Shogun, many of these *Daimyo* try to build their own authority by imposing heavy tarriffs, if not outright trade barriers, rigidly enforced by armored checkpoints where traders are taxed for going from from one domain to another. This isn't just economic; local laws are passed by local lords that supercede the national *Ritsu-Ryo* code, and a lot of them explicitly forbid people leaving their province on pain of death.

## EUROPEANS!

It's during the course of this period that Europeans begin showing up in 1543. Back in the Western World, this is the Age of Exploration. The Spanish are carving up the New World, and the Portugese are establishing settlements across India and Southeast Asia. They recieve words of an extremley wealthy group of islands in Malacca, and send an expedition north, where they land in Nagasaki.

### The Ryukan Kingdom

This kingdom united in 1429, as a tributary of China. It only becomes part of Japan in 1609.

So the Europeans are finally here, landing at Tanegashima.
