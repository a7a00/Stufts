# The Genroku Period

The institutions of the first 3 shoguns produced an extremley stable social system isolated from the rest of the world. The transformations to Japan's social structure due to urban centers creates a bourgeoise-dominated cullture, with enormous achievements in literature, *bunraku* and *kabuki* theater, visual arts and science and philosophy. This period is dominated by the 町人, the bourgeoise, and the 町方, urban populations in general, from workers to laborers and prostitutes.

## Matsuo Basho

This man was the bane of your pen pal's life in high school. He was the son of a *ronin*, and hoped for land and position, which he never got. He had a passion for gay sex, which may have had a part in a scandal. Plus, his master dies in 1666, which prompted his explosion of poetry. In 1680, his disciples give him the "Banana Hut". From 1689 until 1691, he jumps on the growing trend of recreational travel and travels through norther Honshu, recording all sorts of experiences. By the time he dies at 50, he has brought poetry, an elite Heian activity, down to the masses. As a result, poetry starts to chronicle daily life, be written by collaborators, and most importantly, to be funny. There's even a "who's line" style game where you have to finish other people's poetry.

Unfortunatley, none of the great Genroku writers actually get to Tohoku at all.

## Senryuu Karai

This writer popularizes funny haiku.

## Ihara Saikaku

This wealthy merchant game up his house to pursue his love of literature. After his daughter died, he became a monk and gave his shop to his apprentices. He was Japan's first slam poets, who immediatley composed poetry on demand for audiences. He also was one of Japan's first cosplayers, showing up dressed as dutchmen and emperors and famous figures. He wrote longer works and stories, too, which fall into 3 main categories:

* "Merchant House" works reflect the thoughts and feelings of the growing bourgeoise. Some of these are amazing.
* Erotic works include his two famous works:
  * *The Life of an Amorous Man* chronicles the life of a sex-crazed man named Yonosuke as he seeks to have lots of sex. By the end of the book, he's banged 3,000 women and 600 boys. Not bad.
  * *The Life of an Amorous Woman* talks about a woman seduced by one of her first employers, and proceeds to make a very lucrative career out of being a maidsevant with some "extra work" on the side for her employers.
* Samurai works chronicle rivalries, war, revenge and homosexual love between samurai.

## Chikamatsu Monzaemon

This famous playeright writs stories for the bunraku and kabuki stages.

* *Kokusenya* chronicles the life of a famous half-Japanese samurai who fought in China. His glorified battles caught on like wildfire. He portrays the Chinese as effeminate and weaker than the strong and modern Japanese. This will have no negative conequences at all...
* *The 1000 Dogs* makes fun of Tsunayoshi's crazy dog obsession.
* Domestic Plays talk about love and craziness within households. A lot of these end in, well, you know...

### *Shinju*

This is simply seppuku motivated by love. A clash between Confucianism and these new bourgeoise values have love created and thwarted on an unprecedented scale, and Amidism preaches that sucicide can unite two lovers. As a result, seppuku sweeps Japan like never before.

![Yep.](../res/tanto.jpg)

...You're not surprised at all at this point, are you? In response, the Shogunate starts putting up warning a threatening posters around popular seppuku sites.

## 文楽

These puppet shows originate in Kyushu and become incredibly popular. Puppets are very useful for seppuku and self mutilation in stories. Most Japanese drama for the masses was designed for these shows.

## Kabuki

This genre starts in 1603 at Kitano Shrine in Kyoto, started by a woman named Okuni. There's an emphasis on continuing Japan's long history of cross-dressing. Most of the original skits make fun of brothel patrons. She ends up performing on the Kamogawa roverbed in Kyoto, which becomes Japan's Broadway. Kabuki performances often became violent as samurai competed for the favor of the actors. As a result of Kabuki's association with prostitution, women are banned from the performance. This makes boys the focus of the show, which means that theater in Japan becomes a mecca for gays. Because theater becoming a mecca for gays has never been a thing ever. Anyhow, the shogunate bans young male parts. This doesn't work, sso they mandate that all actors shave their forelocks. (This was a sign of being an adult.)

The kabuki fandom responded by wrapping everyone's head in purple scarves. As a result, Japan gets a collective fetish for purple scarves and courtesans tart wearing them. This fetish continues to today. The Shogunate just can't win...

Kabuki plays about *shinju* are banned by the Shogunate because samurai often get so caught up in the show that they cut off body parts and throw them up on the stage.

Seriously, Japan, what the hell?
