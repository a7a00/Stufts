# 文化・文政時代

So, to recap, we have the ultra-deferential Shuxi school, and the progressive Oyomei school, both kinds of Buddhism, but two very different forces that shape Japanese culture. There's also *kokudaku*, the forerunner to Japanese nationalism.

## Cultural Changes

This is a period of cultural flowering, but more importantly, after a stagnation for decades, the population beginds to rise again. The sex ratio of the cities evens out, and servants become female.

### Ienari

This shogun reigned from 1787 to 1837, and wasn't a hands-on ruler at all, as were par the course for shoguns. But what's important is that pop culture shifts from Kansai to Edo itself.

### Ueda Akinari

In 1776, he produces the first *yomihon*, a book meant for reading, similar to our popular literature. Most of his *yomihon*, both from the *Moonlight and Rain* and *Spring Rain* collections, are mysteries. There's also a story about a guy who's seduced by a woman who's actually a servant who ends up killing a bunch of people. There's also one about a virtuous priest who develops a crush on a boy who eventually dies. He then goes nuts and starts eating bodies until he's healed by another priest. Then there's a skeleton that prays. Just another day in Japan.

### Ikku Jippensha

This was Japan's first serial novelist. His work tells the story of Kita and Yaki, two best friends. The elder comes up with an ingenious sheme to get rid of his wife, but kills her instead. As a result, they take to the road, having wacky adventures and trying to score with women. The serial was immensley popular, and people found it hilarious. It was basically the "Beavis and Butthead" or "South Park" of Japan. Even though, it's vulgar, the prose is still incredibly sophisticated. It's immensley popular in Japan today, in the form of anime, manga, light novels, you name it. Because no matter what culture you live in, a dude peeing in the tea supply will always be hilrious.

### Shikitei Sanba

In the Tokugawa period, every city has multiple bathouses, and *everyone* goes to them, often more than once a day. Because, well, Japan likes baths. This author wrote tales centered on the changing fashion and modes of discussion from the baths. These were Japan's first contemporary "slice of life" works, and they spread like wildfire. He also wrote from barber shops as well.

### Peasant rebellions

THere are over 3,000 of these, and they normally go the same way. Peasants, angry about a tax rate too high for the year's yield, will respectfully petition their lord to act virtuously and please let his people live. They also said the same thing to tax collectors themselves, stressing that the divine rule of the emperor is defined by benevolence. Over time, peasants become more bold, tossing these petitions into their lord's palaquin and marching on castle towns. Over time, these become more frequent and more violent as population grows.

### Theater

Kabuki moves to Edo during this period, and two plays cement its new home.

* *Tokubei from India*
* *Ghost Stories from the Tokaido Highway*

### HOKUSAI & HIROSHIGE

W00t! Born in 1760, these guys are the unquestioned masters of woodblock prints, producing views along the Tokaido Highway, beautiful views of Mt. Fuji, and porn. Lots and lots of porn. Tons of tentacle porn, too. Just a normal day in Japan.

## The Tenpou Reform

This reform takes place under Mizuno Tadakuni, a daimyo from Kyushu, who requested and was granted a transfer to Honshu. He was made the Commisioner of SHrines and Temples, appointed as the "virtual head" of Osaka. (Which doesn't have an acual head. Everything is different in Osaka). He then grabs a position in Kyoto, and as a result of his high standing, he's made a *rojuu*, a member of the ruling Counsil. In 1839, in light of famines in the northeast and rebellions in Osaka, he becomes a senior councillor, giving him almost dictatorial power.

### Oushio Heihachiro

The leader of one of the main rebellions, this samurai was a former Osaka policeman. While most cities didn't have much of a police force, everything is different in Osaka. He quits at 36 to become an Oyomei teacher. When his demands for aid for peasants are unmet, he sells his books and raises money to destroy government buildings. This destroys 1/5th of Osaka and fails to inspire an uprising. Overcome with shame, he adds himself to the suicide rosters. Interestingly enough, he's allowed an honorable suicide.

In response to Heihachiro, Tadakuni employs the shockingly original strategy of more sumptuary laws, banning producers of textiles from overproducing from quotas, banning female peddlers in the marketplace, and establishing the *agechirei*, demanding that *daimyo* fork over their land to the shogunate to allow the creation of a broader agricultural base to combat famine. The *daimyo* are not happy. He then dissolves the *kabunakama* to encourage competition. *No one* is happy:

* Distribution networks are screwed over
* Inflation goes crazy and prices soar
* Production slows to a near stop

As a result, Tadakuni falls from power.
