# The Heian Period Continues

## The Fujiwara

The Fujiwara lead a new kind of institution, a regency. Founded by the Nakatomi, the Fujiwara eventually embrace Buddhism and become very powerful following the *Taika* coup. Between 858 and 1184, there are 21 regents. The first regent, the emperor's grandfather is appointed in 858 and given the title *Sesshou*, meaning a regent for a child emperor. Later *Kanpaku* act as regents for adult emperors who voluntarily hand power to the Fujiwara.

### Following the Taika Coup

Nakatomi's son, Fuhito, has 4 sons, creating 4 family lines. All but one die out. Fuhito is made Minister of the Right and marries into the Imperial family, cementing his position. This policy continues as many Fujiwara are married into the Imperial line. (This causes some nasty birth defects as the Imperial family is now 50% interbred Fujiwara.

### Imperial Polygamy

The Emperor had a main consort, a number of other wives, and the right to sleep with whoever he wants. This multiplicity of wives produces many succession disputes with different people backign different candidates. (Fujiwara backed candidates usually win.)

### Sugawara no Michizane

This brilliant poet and Minister of the Right was quite effective at supressing the Fujiwara. However, the Fujiwara fought back by spreading rumors that he wanted a power grab. In response, he was exiled to Kyushu and dies of heartsickness in exile. Immediatley following his death, a plague strikes Heian, and to appease him, a shrine is built to his *kami*, and he is deified as the god of education. As a result, he is prayed to by thousands of students a year for admission into their choice colleges. Anyhow, as a result of his efforts, there was no Fujiwara regent, and the Emperor Daigou ruled personally from 897-930. Following this interruption, the regency becomes permanent.

### Fujiwara Michinaga

Reigning from 966 to 1028, this emperor was related to over 7 emperors and enjoyed the protection of the Minamoto's massive armies.

## Heian Culture

This culture is produced entirely by a small elite. Mere hundreds of people in the capital steer the nation's culture. A very careful distinction is drawn between the *良きびと*, the ruling class of aristocrats and landowners, and the *いやしき人*, base and vulgar people of lower social standing, the masses who couldn't contribute to culture at all. Part of this definition of a good person was literacy, which meant that aristocrats were pretty much all experts in poetry and Chinese texts. There was even a university for Kugei men in Heian with a Chinese language curriculum. (By the Medieval Period, this had died out.) Pleasant handwriting was immensley important and appearance was everything. Women were also encouraged to contribute to literature.

### The "Rule of Taste"

People were expected to show perfect taste, good attitude, pleasant colors, nice handwriting. Basically, you had to show that you were a perfect well mannered person. This fastidiousness continues to exist in Japan today. Clothing was incredibly strict. Noblewomen wore upwards of 12 layers of silk and histories and literary works almost always exhaustively describe her clothes and good taste.

### Pastimes

There's no real need to work for these elites, so they develop some traditional Japanese customs to take their mind off the endless ceremony at the court of what seems like a Japanese Versailles:

* Temple and Shrine visits
* Musical competitions
* Painting competitions
* Poetry composition
* Communication and conversation through tasteful poetic language
  * Picking tasteful paper to write on
  * Sending small gifts with the message
* Archery and falconry
* *Go* and backgammon
* Inscence guessing
* Sumo

Many of these took the form of contests. Those with better taste were afforded higher rank, and sometimes better pay. Society was driven entirely by sophisticated taste and asthetic.

Yeah, Rarity would have liked it.

### Heian Art

During this time, contact with China lapses and trade missions are no longer sent. At the time of Michizane, an enormous planned mission was cancelled for unsure reasons. In any event, this period shows a marked departure from Chinese art. Japanese situations, people and life are showcased, as is the life of the Buddha and uniquely Japanese stories. These are the first paintings that are recognizingly Japanese. The *biwa*, a Japanese lute enables the creation of traditional Japanese music, and is closely tied to Japanese monks. Blind monks travel and play music and the lute becomes a part of Buddhist services. The zither also becomes a big musical phenomenon.

### Heian Literature

* In 900, we get the *Ise Monogatari*.
* In 910, we get the *Taketori Monogatari*, in which an old man miraculously finds a child and raises her. She stays in the house and attracts suitors to whom she gives impossible assignments, which they amusingly fail. She has a one on one correspondence to the Emperor when she reveals she can Apparate. The emperor learnes that moon people are going to come and get her back. The defensive archers fail to stop the *spaceship* that comes and *beams her up*, which causes the emperor to put the letters he wrote to her in Mt. Fuji, where they remain today.
* We also get a travel diary written in a woman's voice (by a man) in phonetic script, not classical Chinese. What's important is that it's a man writing in phonetic Japanese as a woman, showing that the language is splitting according to gender.
* In 974, a Fujiwara woman writes a diary and claims that everything that's been written up to now has been a bnch of fantasy bullshit. She then proceeds to write a story of her horrible marriages. She's a second wife and her husband picks an alley cat over her, which annoys her greatley, She describes their arguments and child raising in vivid psychological detail. Nothing like this exists in Europe at the time. Towards the end, she becomes manic depressive. The last entry says that there's a knock on the door. Since elegant adultery was encouraged, we can only hope that a new man entered her life.
