Literacy arrives in Japan in the 6th Century, relatively late, which means we have a lot of guessing to do. For the most part, we believe that Japan was originally settled millenia ago, while it was still connected to Asia. Unfortunatley, due to the limestone in te soil, there's been a lot of decomposition. The mirst identified culture was known as the Jomon culture, which domesicated animals and fished on a large scale. There are stone tools and giant bones dting back 30,000 or so years. The Jomon are named for their corded ceramic design, and stretched accross the Home Islands, from southern Hokkaido to Shikoku. Evidence from settlement locations suggests that the came from Siberia, not what would become the Korean penninsula, however dental evidence suggests Polynesian or Aboriginal culture. Meanwhile, blood evidence shows a connection to Koreans, Tibetans, Eskimos and Yatskusk Mongolians, specificaly a people called the Buryats, who look extremley similar, as well. Wherever the Jomon came from, the Yayoi (There's another “y” in tere, you pervert) are believed to have come through Korea. From 11,000 BC, we have some of the world's earliest pottery. This pottery is immediatley recognizable by rope patterns, and symbols that we've yet to translate. The Jomon lived mostly in pit dwelllings with thatched roofs that look a lot like Shinto shrines. There's, oddly enough, no apparent class distinction. Everyone seems to have had the same jobs, or at least the same dwellings. The Jomon also created a number of mysterious objects, believed to be fertility artifacts. In Akita, we see sundials and standing stones. Primarily, it was a hunter-gatherer society, and, this being Japan, placed a high emphasis on fishing, producing many advanced fishhooks. There are fences for animals, but no walls, fortifications or any evidence of Jomon wars. After exposure to the Yayoi people (hehe), they began to cultivate buckwheat, soy and hemp. The Jomon spread throughout the archipelago until about 2500BC, when cooling temperature forced them to the coast. The Jomon then experience a population collapse, and the Yayoi rise to prominence. The Yayoi have a full scale wet-rice agricultural system. They definitley come from somewhere in China (the rice grains come from the Yangtze valley), but we don't know how. They could have arrived at any time from 900BC to 400BC. Japanese race has always been a touch. Some Japanese believe that they're a unique race, evolved seperatley from the other since antiquity, while other scholaers claim that the Yayoi, and their Japanese decendants are a result of intermarriage between the ancestors of Koreans and the Jomon. Another theory says that the Japanese are mainly Jomon, only with some Korean influence, while yet another claims that the Yayoi have some Jomon genes, passed through the Ainu and Ryukans. This has a problem, though, in that the Ainu and Ryukans don't look the same at all. It used to be a theory that Yayoi culture drove the Jomon up to Hokkaido, which is supported by records of the time. However the skeletons of warriors with mothers mentioned as Jomon (or Emishi) in records, show no real Jomon traits. Another series suggests that the Jomon and the Yayoi interbred to create a pure Japanese race. The New York Times believes that the Jomon genes run through all Japanese, however that Japanese culture comes from the Yayoi, which is why we have to deal with Kanji. Still others believe that all 3 race are descended from the Jomon and that the yayoi were just added in like crack pairings in fanfics. Okay, I'm done. Anyhow, we believe that the Yayoi language was some form of very early Japanese. Japanese is an Altaic language, onre of the world's largest language groups. Indo-European languages come from Aryans and later Latin and Germanic people, Sinic languages come from Chinese river basins, and Turkic, Mongolian and North Asian languages form the Altaic group. The Yayoi language is believed to have evolved into the Japanese we speak today. The grammar comes from Altaic languages (like Korean), however the vocabulary looks like it comes from the Jomon. Bottom line, there are so many variables that there seem to be no definitive answers. The Yayoi definitley went to war, forged wapons, made more spophisticates pottery fired at higher temperature, and of course, skip over the bronze age and bring Japan from paleolithic times straight into the Iron Age. The Yayoi also begin Japanese sword culture. While some swords are practical, we see status symbol-level swords that were definitley not used. Ceremonial swords were often curved, much like katana and wakazashi, but practical swords were usually always straight. The Yayoi bring standing armies, slavery, class division, and a modern state. This state is tied with China heavily, in 57, a king in Japan (called the Dwarf-Kingdom, or “wa” by the Chinese, which the Japanese still use in 私 and 和食) gets a seal from China, in 107 a king sends 160 slaves to China, in 180 the Chinese write about Pimiko, princess of the state of Yamato, and in 239 the Japanese send envoys to Korea. In Chinese histories written in 297, the Japanese are descriped as iving on the Home Islands, with 30 cities. The Chinese are also schocked by Early Japan's polygamy and gender equality. So where exactly was this state of Yamato? Well, it was either in Kyushu, close to Korea, or Kansai, near Nara and the imperial capital, Kyoto. Throughout the Yayoi period, massive tombs were built, about the size of the Gizan pyrmids, featuring their own terra cotta warriors and horsemen. We're not sure where the horses came from. Some theories state that there was an invasion from the former Koryo empire, replacing the Southeast Asian-style Yayoi culture. This would mean that the yayoi weren't culturally similar to modern Japanese people at all, only linguistically. This also means that the emperors of Japan are descended from Korean invaders. (The Japanese don't like this theory at all.) There are also records of Yamato invaders of Korea near what is now Pyongyang and evidence of a vassalized Baekje, near what is now Pusan. Regardless, Japan's first historically noted emperor from this period was a devout Buddhist. The Chinese claim that men of this early Japanese history forcefully subdued the Jomon into the Yamato state. Circa 500, this state controlled about half of the Home Islands.
