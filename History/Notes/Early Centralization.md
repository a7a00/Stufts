# Early Centralization

## More Buddhism

The Buddha in Japan is unique in that he isn't the only Buddha. There are other Buddhas as well:

### Amida

This Buddha took a vow that he would continue to roam the cosmos after enlightenment, offering salvation and a paradise to those who would pray for him. This concept is so similar to Lutheranism that it terrified Jesuit missionaries when they first came to Japan.

### Kannon

This Buddha represents benevolence and compassion. His monks were told to preach out of feeling for human compassion. In India, the figure is a male, but in China, the figure is androgynous and Japanese images are female. The similarities to Mother Mary scared Jesuits as well.

### Yakushi

This buddha represents healing and medicine.

### Miroku

This Buddha will come at the end of time.

Bodhisattvas are common as well. There are accounts of Buddhist monks going to an oracle and was told that the kami had become a kami out of bad karma. In order to save said kami, these monks built a shinto shrine, showing that religion coexisted quite well.

## The Soga

After the death of Prince Shotoku, the Soga make a successful power grab. They are horribly villified in the *nihon-gi*, but we're told that they:

* Usurped Imperial authority
* Entertained delegations of Emishi, likely Jomon descendants from Easter Honshu. (This was an Imperial responsibility)
* Building fortifications for some likely conflict.

## The *Taika* Coup

In 643, Shotoku's son commits seppuku after having his home attacked by the Soga. His other son was also killed. This didn't exactly endear the Soga to the people of Japan. As a result, two princes from the *Nakatomi* clan (former spiritual ministers) decide to take the power back. They interrupt a *kemari* game, (an early form of soccer) pull a Red Wedding while everyone is distracted and kill the Soga leader, Soga Iruka. The plot was masterminded by two princes, the future leader of Japan and the future leader of the Fujiwara. This will become a very important friendship.

### The Reform Edict

According to the *nihon-gi*, on New Year's 645, this edict is issued by these 2 princes, claiming:

* No more private land, all land belongs to the emperor
* Civil servants must be maintained by "substenance households"
* New administrative system staffed by Imperially chosen local nobles
  * Directly chosen by Emperor
  * Must be in good Confucian standing
* New permanant capital at Naniwa (not the Finnish gamer)
* New system of household and tax registers (Think the *Domesday Book*)
* All old taxes are abolished. New system based on size of rice fields.

We don't think that the Edict was issued this early at all, but we do know it came into existence before the *nihon-ge* was written.

### *Nengo* Era Names

Based on an early Chinese practice, there was a board of diviners at the court who would officially name the era based on natural events with very carefully chosen characters. It's not yet based on the reign of the emperor.

## Emperor Tenji

Prince Naka no Oe, the chief conspirator took this name after issuing his reform. As the emperor from 661 to 671. His most notable achievement was an attempt to intervene in Korea. Unfortunatley, in the Battle of Paekgang, near what is now Incheon, the Yamato are utterly destroyed by the Tang navy. There was no further intervention by Japan in Korea until the 1590's. The Paekchae later falls, resulting in a flood of immigration into Japan. From 665 to 669, over 3,000 families arrived, and about one quarter of citizens in certain areas admitted to mixed ancestry.

In 664, Tenji established a new hierarchial system:

* The first 3 ranks are allowed to become senior ministers.
* Ranks 4 and 5 could become officials or governors.
* Ranks 6-8 could become civil servants.

672 to 694 marks the movement of the capital from Naniwa to Asuka. Sometimes the whole period from Buddhism's introduction to this point is called the Asuka period.

## Emperor Tenmu

After usurping power from Tenji's son in a civil war in 672, Tenmu continues rank reform and commisions the first national histories. By this time, Yamato covers about 2/3 of the Home Island and is allied with autonomous inhabitants of what is now Tanegashima.

## The *Taiho* Code

This code consists of criminal and administrative portions, and is incredibly long. This is the first code directly published, indicating that laws are no longer arbitrary. The emperor's rule is based on the written word. It's modeled after Chinese law codes, but it's adapted heavily. For example, there's no concept of the Mandate of Heaven. The Emperor can do as he likes, as he's naturally divine. It's revised into the *Yoro* code, distributed in 757.

### Government Structure

There are 2 main departments, one for worship, one for state administration. The government is headed by 3 officials, the Chancellor (often left unfilled), the Minister of the Right (military, etc), and the Minister of the Left (tax collection, etc). This government is based in Nara, the first permanant capital of Japan, ending more than 37 different Imperial Capitals.

## Nara

Nara is laied out in a well defined square with Cartesian streets, modeled after Xi'an in China, but without the need for walls. Location was determined of course by Feng Shui. From this point, periods are often named after the locus of power. We are now in the Nara peri
od. (710-784).

### National Histories

It's during this period that we get national histories. The *Kojiki* is written in Japanese, but using Chinese kanji because there's no Japanese writing system yet, making it almost imposible for Japanese people of today. The *Nihon-Gi* is written in Chinese proper and unlike the *Kojiki*, it includes dates. A lot of it is garbage and plagarizes details from Chinese history. It's basically there for show. When we get near the end, however, it becomes very accurate, although it's realy vague. "There was a buddhist mass." "There was a flood. People died." "An auspicious pigeon landed on the Imperial Palace. That's good."

### The Calendar

The Japanese take the Chinese calendar, with 12 30 day months with 3 10 day weeks, and an extra month inserted every 5 years. Each day is divided into "Dawn" and "Dusk", which are each divided into 6 hours apiece. The length of the hour changes to correspond to sunrise and sunset. We also get 5 elements and 12 zodiac houses from the Chinese, which means 60 possible types of years. There are alo 10 "trunks", by which years can have siblings. This is also tied to ideas about the *yin* and *yang* and Chinese medicine.

## Heian

Aftyer a 10 year stay in Nagaoka, the capital is moved to Heian (present day Kyoto).
