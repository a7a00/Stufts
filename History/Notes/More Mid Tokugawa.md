# Changes in Class Structure

## Imperial Relations

The Tokugawa family was quite cosy with the imperial family. Emperor Go-Mizunou'a main wife is Ieyasu's granddaughter, and their daughter becomes the first female emperor since Dokyo and his penis in 770. The SHigunate also builds Nijou Castle in Kyoto, which is the quintessential samurai castle. (Kurosawa filmed there a lot.) It's used a grand total of once until 1863, where Iemitsu says this:

> My grandfather and his son regarded you as equals, and you have had special priveleges. But now I am Shogun by right of succession, and you are now hereditary vassals. The Shogun can do as he likes, and if you do not like this, go back home and let war decide who rules the country.

Nice guy.

### The Robe Affair

The Emperor had usually appointed Zen abbotts to key temples, however in 1629, the Shogunate steps in and imposes more stringent standards. In protest, the emperor resigns. Way to show them, Emperor!

## Wage Labor

These policies of class separation and *daimyo* reporting to Edo leads to massive urban growth, and there's a skyrocketing demand for labor. At the same time, peasants have fled to the cities and become a new group. In time, labor bosses become common. In 1665, as peasant conscription is completley obsolete, Edo esablishes a "Day Laborer's Registry Office". That's right. Japan had JobCentre Pluses before England even started trading with it. Lifelong servants were phased out and paid domestic servants become the norm. (10 years max. allowed by law, to prevent the reemergence of slavery.) 人宿 arrive as well, to house people looking for work and hook them up for jobs. There's this idea that labor becomes a commodity and that *money* drives reactions, not duty.

What's interesting is that wage labor growth occurs by feudal fiat. In pretty much every other industrial society, it was the other way around. Government centralized first.

## Manufacture

With trading centers now in major cities, you no longer need to make things at home and can therefore expand operations nearwhere the goods are sold. Goods like silk are no longer produced for special patrons, but by massive workshops for everybody. Markets like *Izumiya*, founded in the early Edo period, exist today as massive Japanese department stores. Much like Japanese political offices, in Japanese business, what is dead my never die. (Seriously, the Kongō Gumi Construction Company has been going strong for **1,400 years**.) We also see such modern developments as fixed pricing, consumer credit, and free swag with advertising on it if you bought things. Crafty...

## *Kabunakama*

In order to organize their relationships, competing merchants band together and come up with some rules for decency, quality control, coordinated temple visits. These are later orderd by the shogun so they could be taxed.

## Commodification of Housing

Housing is very quickly commodified, as 80-90% of residents in these castle towns are renters. The rest own their own homes. There's an enormous gap between the 2. House owners are reponsible for anything that goes on in their buildings, are required to maintain safety standards, are required to enforce laws, etc. Renters and owners form the 町方, urban commoners. Of course, multi-month rents were the norm in large lodging houses and back alleys. Tax is charged on frontage as well.

## Pleasure Quarters

Sex is commodified, too. Edo's lopsided 354/100 gender ratio means that nearly every castle town has a designated prostitution district after Edo's example. The *yoshiwara* district in Edo (flashbacks much?) is the hugest liscened pleasure quarter in Japan, featuring Edo's best food, music, geisha houses, and of course, prostitutes. *Yoshiwara* becomes the cultural center of Edo, and is the source of hundrers of kabuki plays. Prostitutes set noble fashion throughout Japan. Interestingly enough, male prostitutes were just as common. All you had to do was ask, and some people considered it more righteous to do it with a boy. Go figure.

Much of the above information comes from population registers, originally put in place to track people as registered Buddhists (or Shinto practicioners, in rare cases), to maintain the anti-Christian laws. Religion, servants and families are tracked. Police use these records to track and identify criminals. In villages, especially, there are 5-family teams that mutually police each other. The entire team is punished for the violation of one. That, combined with the fact that, let's face it, these people are Japanese, means that even massive 800-ward cities like Edo need nearly no police. Villages also had local "elders", who basically acted like mayors.
