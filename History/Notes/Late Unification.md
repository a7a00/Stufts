## 城下町

So we discussed last time how lords were only allowed one castle and samurai were required to move there. This results in an enormous urban boom, and overnight, Japan becomes the most urban nation on Earth, predating European urbanization by over a century. Samurai by this point make up 7% of the population, and as a result, a lot of them become very poor. There's an attempt to make life easier through samurai workshops, but they don't really work. Peasants remain on the land they tend, and initially there's an attempt to use a corvee-style system. Unfortunatley, that system falls apart due to distance, and samurai and lords begin going to labor contractors, as money starts to intervene in human relations.

Castles still dominate Japanese cities like Himeji and Matsumoto.

## Hideyoshi's Achievements

### Christianity

In 1587, having visited the Jesuit-controlled city of Nagasaki and been awed by the seminary and printing press, Hideyoshi consults with his generals, panics, and issues an edict banning public proseletization. 10 years later, a Spanish captain from the Phillipines is shipwrecked on Shikoku and his cargo is plundered by locals. Hideyoshi says it's the business of the local *daimyo*. The captain snaps and tells Hideyoshi that Phillip II controls half the world, and that missionaries are but the first step in softening the population. In a fury, Hideyoshi executes 26 Christians to send a message to the Spaniards that their shit won't fly in Japan. He then writes a very angry letter to the Portugese in Goa, informing them that Portugal is religiously intolerant too, and tells him to quit the missionary activity.

### The Korean War

Fun fact-when you say "the Korean war" in Japan, people think of *this*, not MacArthur. That's the "Sino-American War in Korea".

As of 1590's, the Home Islands are squarely under Hideyoshi's control. He doesn't control every single province, but his *daimyo* swear fealty to him and follow his rules:

* One castle per domain
* Land separation
* Obeying the central highway authority
* No alliances

So now what does he do? He has a massie group of samurai with nothing to fight for, but who need to fight. So he decides to let them blow off steam in Korea. Also, Hideyoshi was an egomaniac and had a Napoleon complex and had the nickname "monkey-man". So he decides to overcompensate in a huge way and starts sending out angry letters to the Ryukans and Korea telling them that he's going to mess them up if they don't pay tribute. He also sends one to the Spanish, but this just results in another trade deal and more monks sent to Japan. So that kinda backfires. Hideyoshi also tells Korea in 1582 that he's gonna wreck China and demands safe passage. The Koreans aren't happy, and the Japanese invade in 1592. China, in the beginning of a long history of pushing people south on the Korean Peninsula, fights Japan to a standstill in 1596, with fighting locked at Panmunjom. Hmmm... That doesn't sound familiar at all. There's a second thwarted invasions in 1597.

Anyhow, this is a massive invasion with hundreds of thousands of men, around 10 times the size of the Spanish Armada. Some Christian *daimyo* are involved, and monks begin to visit korea and report about it.

The war is absolutley disgusting in terms of cruelty. There's a mound in 京都 that contains the remains in 38,000 Koreans, mostly noses. Nearly a million KOreans and Chinese die. Up to 200,000 slaves are taken by Japanese slavers, and Korean cropland is destroyed, setting Korea back over 100 years. Naturally, every Korean schoolchild learns about these. (Emi's never heard of it. Go figure...)

### Sen no Rikyu

Enslaved Korean artisans also create some of Japan's finest ceramics. Tea ceremony parties take off in a big way, where warlords show off stolen Korean goods. In 1587, a massive one is held in Kitano, with Hideyoshi and Sen no Rikyu, the inventor of the tea ceremony, as honored guests. A close adviser to Hideyoshi, Rikyu eventually falls out of favor and commits seppuku in 1591. Apparently Hideyoshi was suspicious of his vast property. Or maybe he's just going nuts, as he also orders that his nephew and chsen heir commit seppuku, too, after one of his consorts produced a son. Afraid of a power struggle, he just makes up charges and has his nephew kill himself.

## Tokugawa Ieyasu

Hideyoshi dies of syphilis in 1541, and is succeeded by a council of regents who govern on behalf of his infant son Hideyori, one of whom is Ieyasu, wealthy from avoiding involvement in the Korean War. Friction increases, and we get the battle of Sekigahara in 1600, from which Ieyasu emerges as Japan's sole ruler. His descendants will rule Japan with an iron fist until 1868. While Nobunaga and Hideyoshi fight, Ieyasu bides his time and waits until he has a big enough force to go get what he wants.

> "Nobunaga harvested the rice, Hideyoshi made the *mochi*, Ieyasu ate them."
