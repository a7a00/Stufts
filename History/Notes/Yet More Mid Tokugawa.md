# More Tokugawa

## *Tozama* and *Fudai* Daimyo

Basically what you need to know about this group is that while the *Tozama* has bigger, more distant domains, thanks to their loss at Sekigahara, they lose the ability to run the government. But they're much wealthier than the *fudai*, who monopolize government offices and become commisars.

## Samurai Dissatisfaction

During this time, the role of the samurai changes. In addition to the way of the warrior, the samurai must become cultured, men that the Japanese people can look to for scolastic inspiration. As the *samurai* become literate beuraucrats, some become annoyed that they can't fight, so they become criminals instead.

### *Hatamoto Yakko* and *Machikata Yakko*

These "bannermen" are direct retainers of the Shogun and command a yearly income of 100 *koku*. Lots of these guys have issues. (One rapes a page and later commits seppuku-surprise, surprise) But their pages are worse. They begin to attack commoners out of jealousy over wealth accrued by merchants. In response, these "town gangs" form to protect the townspeople. Street gangs become prevalent in Japan, with gang symbols, gang colors and graffiti. Remember that it's 1700. Gangsters of both stripes also run illegal gambling dens.

### The *Keian* Incident

This is Japan's November 5. In 1651, roughly 45 years after Guy Fawkes, angry *ronin*, led by martial artist Yui Shousetsu and his student Marubashi Chuuya, plan to blow up Tokugawa castle. They were caught after Chuuya let slip some details to the police while drunk, and was executed. Shousetsu avoided this fate by... do I even need to say it?

As a result, the shogunate sets up police boxes and steps up police efforts.

## Tsunayoshi and the Genroku Period

The 4th shogun Ietsuna doesn't so much, and he's followed by his brother Tsunayoshi, who rules from 1680 to 1709. And he presides over the Genroku period. It's during this time that the commoners of Japan take the cultural stage. Tsunayoshi himself was a controversial figure. He was a:

* Neo-confucianist scholar
* Patron of Buddhism
* Fan of and performer of *no* drama

He also passed sumptuary laws, specifying everything from required roofing material to gate size to house space to, most importantly, *clothes*. Commoners were not allowed to wear fancy silk. Cotton or hemp only. Hemp loses its popularity as well. People find ways around the dress code, wearing fancy underwear instead. Take that, society! Now I'm wasting money and you *can't* see it! HAHAHA!

Tsunayoshi also had a large sexual appetite. He was also really kinky. By *Japanese* standards. As a result of this, he was unable to have a male heir, so in order to up his karma, he passed laws ordering compassion towards animals. Oh, Japanese Buddhists. You can go ahead and do unspeakable things, but if you can't concieve, be nice to dogs. Such an accepting religion.

Fun fact: this is Japan's second dog nut!

His animal laws were actually sweeping, covering pack horses, show birds, hunting, fishing, etc. His laws about dogs included addressing the dogs honorifically (犬さま) and not abusing them. In the end, people get sick of the dog shit everywhere and start putting the dogs in kennels at public expense. People get really sick of dogs being so powerful, and start calling Tsunayoshi the "Dog Shogun". A black market in dog meat grows out of spite, and a samurai executes a dog for "abusing shogunal authority". I think we know what happens to him.

This episode is satirized in numerous plays.

Tsunayoshi also hosted huge dormitories on the grounds of his Edo mansion for his pages. He was criticized roundly for elevating peasants like this, but he's the *shogun*, so he basically tells everyone to screw off.
