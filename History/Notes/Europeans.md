# Europeans

What did we mmiss last time? Not much, except for the names of Portugese people who came. Oh, and **gunpowder**. Gunpowder was already known from the time of the Mongol invasions, but the Portugese bring muskets and arquebuses, which the Japanese *love*, and by several decades later, Japanese muskets, produced by swordsmiths, were not only different than their European cousins, but of consistently high quality.

## Food and Consumables

* Potatoes - The Dutch spearhead the intruduction of this American crop to Japan from settlements in Jakarta, giving us the modern Japanese *じゃがいも*.
* Sweet Potatoes - Same story, but they were introduced in Satsuma, hence *さつまいも*. It's made into an alcohol called *shouchu*, which remains super popular in Kyushu.
* Squash - Introduced through Cambodia
* Maize - Never becomes too popular in Japan.
* Bread - Known as the Portugese パン today.
* Tempura - Initially a Portugese cuisine, becomes a craze among samurai
* Wine - Nobles love it.
* Sugar - Originally unknown to Japan, plantations are built on Okinawa and cane sugar is grown on the Home Islands.
* Candy - A novelty loved by Oda Nobunaga
* タバコ - Japan is no exception to the worldwide tobacco addiction of the 1500's. Everyone accross society loves to smoke, and smoking becomes central to popular culture. Even today, Japan has an enormous smoking habit. The original pipes used were based on a Laotian design.

## 黒人

Slaves become common in Portugese visits, especially after the Portugese establish a base in Macau in 1557. These are Japan's first black people, and Japan doesn't know what to make of them. They were seen as coming from the land of the Buddha, and as they looked like depictions of the Buddha (lips, hair, eyes), they were treated with enormous respect. As a result, several of them leave to become samurai, loved by their daimyo. (Because if you're a 5 foot samurai, having a 6 foot black guy as your opponent would terrify you.)

## Christianity

Francis Xavier arrives in 1549, and took it upon himself to venture to Japan and convert these people to Christ. Europe at this time is in the throes of the Reformation, and the Council of Trent has just convened. He arrives in Japan with two other Jesuits, baptizes around 100 Japanese (a lot of whom think he's championing some strange sort of Vairocana Buddhism), and gains the attention of Zen priests, who invite him to come and discuss their faiths. The Jesuits say that they want to go around the world and bring new people to the Christian faith, and are invited to speak with numerous *daimyo* interested in trade. What's very interesting is that these conversations are always civil and polite. He never gets to visit the emperor, though, and dies in 1551.

## Western Views of Japan

> "The Japanese are...the best race yet discovered and I do not think you will find their match among the pagan nations" - Francis Xavier

> "The people are white and cultured; even the common folk and peasants are well brought up and they are all so remarkably polite that they give the impression they were trained at court. In that respect, not only are they superior to the other Asians, but to us as well. They are capable and intelligent, and their children easily grasp our lessons. They learn to read and write our language far more quickly and easily than children of Europe. The lower classes are not coarse and ignorant; they are intelligent, well brought up, and quick to learn" -Alessandro Valignano

This is crucial. The Jesuits see Japan as a kind of "white" people. Many of these Jesuit reports say that the Japanese are better than the Europeans. Other Asians are derided as "black, and of small sense...difficult to convert to good Christians", while the Japanese are praised as "white...of good understanding and behavior". Europeans already begin to paint the Japanese as Asia's superior race. In many of these writings, we also see Europeans get an inferiority complex as to the culture they're trying to convert. "Exclusing the advantage of religion, we are utter barbarians compared to them. I learn something new from the Japanese every day."

These missionaries also integrate and adopt Zen practices. There's an enormous desire to become more Japanese ampng the Europeans. Christian material becomes adapted for the *biwa* and *kabuki* theater. Jesuits also begin to take baths daily.

There's also a love for Japanese women. They are seen as "graceful and kind as their husbands are cruel". They are seen as women with almost no defects although their men "drink like the French".

## Later Christians

Up to the 1590's, nearly 300,000 out of 12 million Japanese convert. Some convert through genuine conviction, and others are converted through the explanation of Vatican logicians. Daimyo who converted would somethimes order their subjects to convert. In the 1580's. the sons of 3 converted *daimyo* go on a mission to Europe, and were paraded around. IN Europe, the Japanese are celebrated as great heroes, and of course denied any contact with Lutherans.
