## Stasis

As peace swept Japan, literacy grows, agriculture grows more productive as peasants learn how to read and not be terrified of *samurai* armies. That, combined with the policies encouraging urban growth, causes a massive population boom. But, at around 25 million, the population suddenly freezes in place. Why? Well, Japan has become so well off at this time, that people could be sure of every child surviving. As a result, family planning and abortion explode in popularity, Buddhists are OK with this, while Shinto believers hate it, believing it to be murder. In adition to population stasis, there's political stasis as well; *hei-no bunri*, *sankin koutai* and *sakoku* remain formal and fixed policies.

Power does shift during this time though, gradually away from the shogun and to advisers and servants. (Because this has *never* happened in Japanese history, where one office is quietly upstaged by another)

### Tanuma Okitsugu

Originally a page to Ieshige, this boy rose to be the shogun's right hand man, laying out his clothes, pouring tea-and running the damn country. It was he who modernized Japan's response to the 2 devastating famines we talked about last week. Widely believed to be completley corrupt, he was an early supporter of free market capialism, overseeing the creation of a ton of *kabunakama*, some of which existed in the same city, selling the same wares, to encourage... competition! Yay capitalism! (Some of these came back as enormous *zaibatsu* suring and after WW2, such as Toyota and Mitsubishi.) Nonetheless, Okitsugu wasn't very popular, as many believed him to put money over politics, which he kind of did. Famine also darkened his reign.

After his son is assasinated, Okitsugu dies, and is soon discredited, as people discover he took a ton of bribes throughout his career. This pressure's the Tokugawa government to issue more reforms.

## The Kansei Reforms

These are implemented from 1787 to 1793, by elder Matsudaira Sadanobu. (The Shogun at this point is wholly irrelevant.) There's a crackdown on porn, a ton of new sumptuary laws, a roundup of beggars and vagabonds, and most importantly, a crackdown on illegal migrants. If you weren't in Edo with proper papers, you were simply kicked out. Matsudaira also founds the Yoseba Workshop in Edo, where vagabonds and beggars are rounded up and forced to work. Yoseba was a pretty shitty place to work. People worked about 12 hours a day making cheap commodities like sandals, with only occasional breaks for lectures about how great works is.

> "Some people thought that the yoseba was cruel; I say it's a prime example of 人生. We teach people how to work and how to value their work, and that is a precious gift." -Matsudaira Sadanobu

People too destitute or impaired to work properly were given ID's entitling them to go door to door begging. Problem is that these people soon are classified as *ひにん*, subhumans. (They prefer the term *bunrakumin*, people of the hamlets). Combined with the people who shed blood, this suhuman class is refereed to as *eta*, people of filth. Oh, a note. If you ever, **ever** ***ever*** go to Japan and use this word, you are asking to get punched in the face *at least*. This word is amazingly bad. Descendants of these people are still treated badly, even today.

### Philosophy

There are also reforms of philosophy. The *Shuxi* school says that people are born confused and need a state and ritual to teach them  formal behavior. The *Oyome* school is more flexible, assuming that people are naturally good, and produces more revolutionary thought. So by the 18th century, there's a multiplicity of Japanese philosphy, including *atheism*, and the ability to say that the *Kojiki* is probably based off rulers from China. Compare this to Enlightenment France. Christianity is still banned though.

### *Kokodaku*

Emi should have you familiar with this! Kada no Azumamaro writes to the Enperor around the 1700's, saying that since money is lavished on Indian and Chinese knowledge, and argues for more emphasis on the study of Japanese literature. In Chinese... I'm not entirely sure how that works. He and his successors argue that the *Manyoshu* from way back in the Nara period shows that the Japanese are so much better and more macho than the Chinese in literally every way. His successor Motori Norinaga, a Shinto believer from a Pure Land Buddhist mother, prioritizes the specialness and divinity of Japan, the Home Islands, and the Japanese people. He places Japan as a devine nation, above all others on the world. This will have no bad consequences at all. (Well, according to official records, nothing bad happened at all. Stop asking questions.) Interestingly enough, he points out that the Japanese are *feminine* and aesthetic.

> "The westerners have their Commandments, the Chinese have the Analects, the Indians have the Sutras. We have none, for we are inherently good, a race descended from the gods."

During the reign of Norinaga's successor, Hirata Astsutane, Western visitors and traders are villified as filthy barbarians, and major thinkers begin arguing that Japan, the land of the gods, is being menaced and needs to fight back.

Samurai, dissatisfied with their lot, use this as a justification to claim that the Shogunate are illegitemate and that Power should rest with the emperor, descended from the gods. (NOTHING BAD IS GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THIS.)

Isn't it ironic that *shinto* is the Japanese faith that ended up getting militarized. Guess oldies are goodies.
