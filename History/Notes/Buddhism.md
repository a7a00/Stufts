# Religion in Early Japan

## The State of East Asia in 500

By 500, the Yamato state encompasses the southern Home Islands, but does ot include Southern Kyushu or the Tohoku reigon, also possibly containing a Koran enclave. There are multiple classes in this society

* Uji - Clans of aristocrats, responsible for specialized functions (rice, cloth, etc.)
* éƒ¨(Be) - Groups of workers subordinate to the population.
* Yatsuko - Slaves. We have no idea what these people were like, but we can estimate 5% of the population.

The Yamato is also in contact with 3 Korean kingdoms:

* Koryo - Today's North Korea and Manchuria
* Shilla - Small, but can kick serious butt. They end up conquering their larger neigbors and raiding the Yamato.
* Paekche  At war with Shilla, and thus a friend of the Yamato.
* Kaya - We don't know much about this reigon. The Japanese claim it was part of Yamato, while Korean historians claim it was a Korean tribal confederation. Regardless, there was a Yamato presence, if the Japanese histories can be believed.

## Buddhism

In 538, Budddhism arrives from Paekche, having already travelled from India to Afghanistan to China to Tibet, spreading into South Asia and eventually Korea and Japan.

### Brahmanism

Buddhism is a response to Brahmanism, which has, among other things.

* Deep connections with the ancient Aryans (The jury is still out if it's an invasion or a migration.)
* *Varnas*, the precursor to the modern caste system, born out of attempts to subjugate the indigenous population
* A *Brahman* priesthood caste
* A *Khysatria* warrior class
* Merchants above peasants, not the other way around as in China and Japan
* Polytheism with a vengance
* A language descended from Greek and Latin (*Maharaja* = *Magna* + *Regum*)
* The concept of an ultimatley transcendent being, manifested in 3 beings:
  * Brahma, the creator
  * Vishnu, the preserver who returned as an avatar to save mankind
    * Rama
    * Krishna
  * Shiva, the destroyer
* *Atman*, the immortal soul and reincarnation, is determined by Karma. Obey your dharma, you move forward.
* *Maha-atman*, being absorbed into Brahman, breaking the cycle of reincarnation and reching *nirvana*

### So What's Buddhism?

Buddhism was a marked departure from Brahmanism.

* No *atman*, no gods, no self. You are constantly changing and are not your own individual.
* No creator
  * The universe has always existed
  * The enlightened human or sentient being is greater than a god
  * Constant sentient beings, some incredibly powerful, but none are divine
* No *samsara* of the self. Karma still works, but we don't know how.
  * One possible solution is to see the self as consisting of 5 parts, including conciousness
  * 4 parts dissolve, but conciousness is tranferred
  * Not all buddhists agree on this
* No basis for caste distinction - anyone can shoot for enlightenment.
* The legend of Buddha
  * Miraculous birth and prophecies about the future
    * In northern India, there was a rajah with an extremley righteous wife
    * She elected to stay apart from her husband for a year to maintain her self
    * She has a vision of being impregnated by a while elephant
    * She then becomes pregnant and tells her husband to get there five minutes ago.
    * The rajah is then told by angels that his wife is pregnant with a magnificent child
  * As the son of a rajah, Siddartha Gautama leads a luxurious and sheltered life. His father arranges this on purpose, fearing that his son will become a prophecised religious leader, not a prophecised conqueror.
  * He then leaves the palace to see the world 4 times, seeing 4 sights not available inside the palace.
    * Sickness
    * Old Age
    * Death
    * An ascetic holy man
  * Gautama renounces his pleasures, leaves his wife and son and becomes a holy beggar.
  * Temptation
    * Gautama has become a guru with 10 disciples, wandering around engaging in near-death austerities
    * After accepting milk for strencth, his disciples leave him in disgust.
    * While meditating, an evil figure tempts him with the kingdoms of the world and lewd dancers, but Gautama says no.
    * After resisting temptation, he becomes the enlightened Buddha, charged by Brahma to share his knowledge with the world.
  * The first sermon
    * Was given either to disciples or more likely merchants
    * 4 Noble Truths (I ain't writing this down, you know this.)
    * Eightfold path
    * Middle way
    * Law of impermanence
* Three Treasures
  * The Buddha
  * The Dharma
    * Rules for monks and nuns
    * The *sutras*, sermons of the Buddha
    * Commentaries on the sermons by bodhisattvas
  * The monastic community
  
Since the first collection of canon was put together in 529, long after the Buddha dies, we can imagine that there was some corruption.
