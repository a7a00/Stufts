# The Kenmu Restoration

Remember that in the aftermath of the Mongol invasion, the Samurai couldn't be compensated, simply because there was no land. You also have the Houjou regency coming under fire, and there's a lot of opposition among the Samurai because of debt, and among the merchant because that debt was *unpaid*. The Emperor is also unusually assertive during this time.

## Go-Daigo

An emperor at age 31, Go-Daigo is a neo-Confucianist. Now, neo-Confucianism, like its earlier cousin, claims that the emperor has power because he is ethical and just. It's different from Confucius' idea, though. While traditional Confucianlism looks at the family of the basic unit and sees the state as an extension of that, Zhu Xi, the father of the movemement, looked at things from the top down. Earth below heaven, subject below ruler, woman below man, young below old. This is a reallly politically useful idea. His reign is eventful, defined by his plots to win back power. In 1324, he's involved in a plot to topple the Shogunate. He escapes blame, but is caught a second time, when he's exiled to Oki island.

### Ashikaga Takauji

When Imperial generals rise up against the Houjou regency, the Houjou send him after them. He's also a flipflopping figure, viewed as a traitor by the Japanese.

* In 1333, he's sent to squash a rebellion headed by Kusunoki Masashige.
* He then turns on Kamakura, squashing the shogunate and puts the emperor on the throne.
* Remember, Go-Daigo wants to end feudal estates, so they rely on Ashikaga to get them fights.
* In 1336, he betrays Go-Daigo.
* In 1337, he rejoins him.
* That same year, he betrays him again.

This causes chaos in 京都.

>Among these things commonplace in the capital are nighttime attacks, robbers, conuterfeit edicts, dishonest monks...

#### Kou no Moronaro

Ashikaga's chief lieutenant had some radical things to say.

>What's the use of a King? Why should he live in a palace? WHy do we bow to him? If a King is indeed needed, let's have one made of wood or metal.

This made him less than popular.

Remember, there's no religious or ideological issues at play, like in Europe's religious wars which gradually became less religious. This is purely about land and power grabs.

## Key Fighters

### Prince Morinaga

Go-Daigo's son becomes chief abbot of the *Enryakuji*. He then commands warrior monks against the Shogunate in 1331, is made Shogun in 1333, and is kidnapped by a relative and killed in Kamakura the next year as part of an unsuccessful Houjou bid to keep power. Note that these are "peaceful" Buddhist monks...

### Nitta Yoshstada

Originally allied with the Takauji, but breaks with him and fights on behalf of Go-Daigo. He's defeated in 1338.

### Ashikaga Tadayoshi

Takauji's younger brother also breaks with the Kamakura government. In 1338, he works with his brother to establish a new one. In 1350, however, his opposition to Kou no Moronaro, causes him to split and rebel against his brother.

## The Ashikaga Shogunate

Go-Daigo has to flee and sets up shop in Yoshino. Takauji puts another one on the throne in 京都. This causes a "period of instability". The Yoshino court commands the southern *daimyo*, while the 京都 court controls those in the north.

### Kitabatake Chikafusa

This historian argues that trouble only comes to Japan when they make a wrong choice in emperors.

Takauji and his sons become shoguns and quickly change some key features. The *shugo*, military governors, become *shugo-daimyo*, and begin owning land. These governors are still dependent on their vassals to maintain order, but Japan is split into anormous chunks.

### Ashikaga Yoshimitu

Arguably the most important Ashikaga shogun, this shogun works out an arrangement, whereby the Yoshino court shuts down, and that emperor returns to the capital. It's agreed that power will rotate between the two emperors. A peaceful, if confusing compromise. He also reestablishes ties with China, which had been cut off since the Mongol invasion. Following unification, and the re-opening of Kyushan ports. He also accepts a subordinate status from the Ming, which is unpopular, but worth it. On his deathbed, he tells his son to cease this trade, but it continues until the 1540's, with slightly different rules. He's also an enormous patron of the arts and sponsors the creation of *No* drama. He also builds the *Kinkakuji*.

#### *No* Drama

That's right, no drama at all. Hehe. Anyhow, this art style flourishes under the Ashikaha shoguns, and there's a set of extremley famous playwrights, and a whole slew of concepts that are very important.

* Elaborate Backgrounds
* Heroes
* Foils
* Masks and Costumes

We'll see some next week!
