# Presentation Outline - The Evolution of Humor in Manga

## Title Slide

Yeah, we're outlining the whole thing because I don't trust you alone in Eaton. Name. Class. Little picture of a farting dude from the *he-gassen* in the corner. You know, normal stuff.

## Origins of Manga

Start by introducing the concept of Japan artistically seperating from China, possibly by having vector outlines of the two countried smash into each other.

* China was heavily focused on ink wash painting - Have Chinese painting move into background behind Chinese side
* Japan chose to deature small objects, detailed interiors and selective backgrounds - Have Jap painting do likewise
* Japan's style lent itself to the telling of stories

## Evolution of Manga

Zoom in on Japan. The subjects of the Japanese painting blur as we zoom past them, and the background becomes the new permanant background. Local border lines appear.

Manga as we know it has its roots in the Heian period. (Kyoto displays the word 平安 and we zoom in so that it becomes the title) At this time, Japan was proud of its own identity and started producing pictures with no accompanying text. The first example is the *Shigisan-Engi*, (show it) which shows the miracles of a monk living near Nara. The scenes are very active, but are still incredibly serious. However, humor also appears, such as in the *Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga*, (show it) which shows animals dancing and fighting in Buddhist vestments. The idea that Japanese art could tell stories like this lent itself to satirical comics very early on.

Zoom out. Only Kyoto should be visible. Explain that the Genpei War and the establishment of the Ashikaga Shogunate kept this culture confined to Heian, as the Ashikaga shogunate chose to sponsor depictions of warriors. (Various depictions of warriors go by in the background. Explain that the chaos of the Waring States period allowed art to be transmitted more readily to other areas of the Kanto plain. Other prefctures come into view, and then light up with representative art.

## The Edo Period

Trasition to a single title slide. Explain that the Edo period was the period when manga truly became humorous. Show the He-gassen and explain what is is, and then just pan along it for slide trasitions.

* Ukiyo-e - Explain the origins of the medium with the rise of the bourgeoise in Japan. Talk about Hokusai and Hiroshige's serialized prints depicting stories and humorous situations. Explain how many modern manga and printing techniques were developed around this time. Show the 36 Views and the Great Wave to illustrate technique. Point out that horror and humor developed together.
* Shunga - This was basically ukiyo-e pornography. It was considered by many to bring good luck, and its status as a household item meant that a lot of themes were explored. Japan also mass-produced its fascination with tentacles.
* Kamishibai - These early forms of narrated print displays put pressure on artists to make sequential prints and scrolls that would keep audiences hooked. It was after one of these shows that Hokusai coined the term "manga", or "playful drawing"
* Kibyoshi - These picture books were circulated as quick ways to spread news, but they very rapidly became a tool of social satire, poking fun at everything from the devaluation of silver to having violent samurai in civil positions. These are what truly sparked the rise of Japanese comic book culture, which Japan was happy to find it shared with England. (Japan Punch was a huge hit)
