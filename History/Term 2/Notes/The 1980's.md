# The 1970's and '80s

## The Nixon Shocks

In 1968, Nixon is elected amid a global climate of political instability. Nixon protects US interests from Japanese competition with a 10% tariff on fabric and electronics, causing 300,000 Japanese to lose their jobs. Automobiles gradually become the key issue, witht e Corolla being one of the best selling cars in Japan. In 1960, Toyota was only making around 30,000 cars a year, but when they're allowed to enter the US market in '68, and by 1975, annual output had reached 1.8 million. Today, Japan is the world's, second largest car exporter. Nixon's own relationship with Japan was rocky. In 1954, as vice predident, he had urged Japan to form the Jietai from its existing police force. In 1971, he announced that he would return Okinawa to Japan. (Many protest the remaining bases.) Despite these measures, he is remembered for the 3 "Nixon Shocks":

* The 1968 Tariffs
* The departure of the US from the Bretton Woods Accords
* His restoration of ties with China without consulting Japan.

Nixon left Bretton Woods, noting that more fiat currecy existed than covered by gold reserves. As a result, we go ahead and persuade Saudi Arabia to only accept US dollars. This status as a "petro-currency" helps keep the dollar strong. As a result, the yen is unpegged from the dollar as well.

Of course, the Japanese are also pissed when they recieve only a few hours notification of Nixon visiting China. Following Sato Eisaku's term, the next PM, Tanaka Kakuei quickly establishes relations with the PRC before we can. Kakuei is an interesting character, not goming from where most blue-blooded PM's come from. He extends the Shinkansen to curry favor with rural voters and grows to lead the biggest LDP faction. In 1972, he publisheds a book, *A Plan fo Remodeling the Home Islands*, which draws attention to him as a creative thinker. In 1974, after criticism of his financial dealings, he gets caught up in the Lockeed scandal. You can guess what happens.

### The Lockeed Scandal

This is one of many scandals that chips away at the credibility of the Japanese government. In 1976, a US court determines that Lockeed had bribed multiple *zaibatsu*, the sitting Prime Minister, and *yakuza* connections to get their mitts on military aircraft. This causes many people to become disillusioned with the LDP.

### The Arab Oil Embargo

As you know from APUSH, following the Yom Kippur War, OPEC fires back at the US for supporting Israel with the oil embargo. Japan is considered as a US ally, and falls under the embargo, causing problems much as there were here. As a result of the only negative growth rate that year, Japanese officials desperatley try to improve ties with the Muslim world. Petroleum is stockpiled, and Japanese cars are required to go at 60 MPG for small vehicles, 45 MPG for cars, and 40 MPG for trucks. Japanese cars are already adorably tiny, so it isn't a huge deal for many citizens.

The second oil shock follows the Iranian Revolution, but Japan doesn't follow the lead of the US, and remains the #1 purchaser of Iranian oil, even up until 5 years ago, when it was passed by the PRC. Xixixixixi...

## The Miracle Continues

As a result of the embargo, many US consumers choose more efficient Japanese cars. At the same time, Japan grows to produce most of the world's electronics. By 1980, 84% of US TV's are made in Japan.

And then, Sony introduces the Walkman, and completley takes over the market. Not only does this cement Japanese control of the US electronics market, but does 3 more things:

* Sony starts making karaoke machines, kick-starting Japan's newest national tradition.
* The RIAA demands that walkman's are banned for encouraging home taping, which allows people to share mixtapes and-*gasp*-skip ads! (Fuck you, RIAA...)
* Tapes allow people to pirate music and share phone phreaking tones, kick starting hacker culture, and encouraging its growth in Japan.

### The Golden Age of Arcades

3 words. ***WAKA, WAKA, WAKA***

Arcades go absolutley nuts in the US. Pachinko remains the addictive smoking accompaniment of choice in Japan.

### Hirohito Visits the US

By this point, Japan has massive salary advantages, provides more foreign aid, joins the G6 with us, and causes massive Japan-bashing here at home. You see the growing fear theat Japan will take over the world in films like *Alien* and *Blade Runner*. In this context, Hirohito visits the US in 1975, insists on visiting Disneyland and buys a Mickey Mouse watch, which he wears for the rest of his life. He's buried in it, actually. (Take that, Japan!) US workers are not assuaged, and continue smashing Corollas in protest. As a result, MITI encourages export controls, Japanese banks buy US treasury bonds, and Japanese automakers move some production to the US. The first to open is the Honda plant in Marysville, but operations move to non-union states, with Honda and Toyota opening plants in Tenessee.
