# More Meiji Changes

So we left off with the Emperor Meiji consolidating his power. Once this starts happenning, it speeds up.

* In 1869, all *daimyo* surrender their domains to the Emperor, becoming governors instad of lords, and having their (huge) debts forgiven by the State.
* A new currency act gets rid of the myriad currency, and introduces the *yen*, equal to 1 Mexican Silver Dollar.
* A railway opens up between Tokyo and Yokohama, financed by a British loan, built by 300 foreign employees. (No loans were ever taken out again, for fear of the West gaining a bargaining chip in future negotiations.)
* The tax system is reformed, now based on cash value of the land. Taxes are paid in cash, not rice, and go down from 50% to 3%. Not bad. In addition the *landowner*, not the *tenant*, is now responsible for paying taxes. However, the amount of taxes that follow don't leave the peasants any better off.
* In 1870, commoners can get surnames (Many just choose things like 山本, or some other location based name)
* In 1871, swords become optional for samurai.
* In 1873, samurai stipends are taxed
* In 1873, all able bodied males are eligible for conscription
* In 1873, all samurai stipends become bonds, and the samurai are encouraged to go into business.
* In 1876, swords and *chonmage* are completley banned.
* In 1871, the *hinin* and the *eta* are emancipated, reclassified as *shin-heimin*. People become horrified, there are riots, and attempts to forcefully keep them out of public schools.

There are now 400,000 samurai with no source of income. Many are encouraged to move to Hokkaido in light of anti-Asian immigration laws elsewhere.

## The Iwakura Mission

During this mission, from 1871-1873, half of the Japanese elite pack up and go on a grand tour of US and Europe. Led by a court noble, Iwakura Tomomi, Okubo from the unification, Kido Takayoshi from Choushu, and Ito Hirobumi, who would later become the first Prime Minister. In addition to learning about Western culture, they argue for the revision of the treaties.

## Fukuzawa Yukichi

This Satsuma samurai pushes Japan to learn English rather than Dutch, and advocates the abolition of legal gender distinction. His colleague, Naakmura Masanao argues that women should not be equal, rather they should be "good wives and wise mothers". THe magazine these 2 published in, the *Meiroku Zasshi*, scared the regime into passing the Press Ordnance and Libel Law of 1875, ending anonymity of the press.

## The Deer Cry Hall

This Western style building was created to allow the Japanese and Western aristocrats a place to mingle. Venitian masked balls and Vienesse waltzes were common. This comes under fire not only for its discarding of Japanese culture, but for its massive price tag.

## The Number 9 and Gankiro Brothels

In all of the major port cities, there are brothels for foreign men only, usually in order to keep the ones for Japanese people Japanese-only. All prostitution is regulated for foreigners through brokers, many of whom work for these 2 companies, history's first (and nly) brothel chains.

## Education

Japan already had a very high literacy rate (around 40%) before the Meiji restoration. Most learning was done in temple schools before the Meiji Era. After study of Western models, a French-style centralized public school system was established that still exists to this day. Japan's finest universities are founded at this time as Imperial Colleges. Mori Arinori, the first Minister of Education, even considers ditching Japanese in favor of French. Japanese students are originally encouraged to study abroad to bring back English knowledge and curricula. Within 10 years, literacy reaches 100%.

## Korea

Hoo, boy, here we go. Japan had enjoyed a close relationship with Korea during the Tokugawa regime, but Japan's repeated requests for friendly discussion are denied by a Korea terrified of Western inroads into Japan. All western and Japanese missions to Korea are told they have to take it up with Beijing. People call Korea a "potential dagger" and a bridge to invasion of the Home Islands. People argue that Korea's isolationism is ground for Japan to send a mission to be attacked and killed. Japan will then use this as a pretext to invade. Meiji urges that the Iwakura team get back before a decision is reached. When the people on the mission get the telegrams, they're horrified, and tell their colleagues in Tokyo to quit it if they want any hope of being taken seriously. Saigo Takamori, the chief architect of the invasion plan, resign in protest

So what happens to everyone leaving the government? Well, some harness the power of a new Western media, the newspaper, publishing printed opinion pieces and starting petitions. Of course others rise up in armed insurrection, put down by the newly expanded police forces.

## Christianity

The Japanese are still terrified of Christianity, but in the spirit of cooperation, it's legalized, which causes massive uproar.

## Political Parties

Itagaki Taisuke, an official from Tosa Prefecture, leaves over the Korea argument and goes back to Tosa to start Japan's first political party pushing for equal rights, equal justice, fair laws... and invading Korea. Can't have everything, I guess.

## Financial Crisis

Supressing all these revolts nearly bankrupts the government. Japan's finance minister Matsukata Masayoshi (another guy from Satsuma) untertakes a deflationary policy, withdrawing paper currency, raising taxes, dropping central rice prices, etc. This causes an explosion in tenancy, as well as a surge of bankrputcies. People also become angry at Japan privatizing a lot of her industry in a massive sell-off of government properties. But, at the same time, the reserves-to-currency ratio goes from 8% to 33%.

## Ryukyu

Japan still maintains formal relations with Ryukyu, an independent country, throughout the Tokugawa era. In 1609, Satsuma had invaded it and made it a vassal. Ryukyu was therefore a tributary of China, Satsuma, and the Shogun. This ends in 1872, when the Japanese pronounce Satsuma a feudal domain, and encourage the Ryukan king to do what the *daimyo* had done. Okinawa becomes a prefecture in the 1880's.

## Hokkaido

Aside from Mitsumae, a small city in the south, there are no Japanese in Hokkaido, just Ainu, as has been the case for most of history. That changes as thousands of samurai flood in, becoming soldier-farmers and homesteaders. A Colonization Headquarters is set up to facilitate the proccess.
