# The Beginnings of Imperialism

## The Russo-Japanese War and the Portsmouth Treaty

OK, so last time, the Japanese sneak-attacked the Russians, starting the Russo-Japanese war. A string of Japanese victories, including Togo Heihaciro's famous fictory at Tsushima, stuns the world. In the midst of this mess, the Czar orders the Russian Baltic fleet to travel around Africa to Tsushima, giving us the famous battle, the first time a great power had even been defeated by a non-Western power, and Japan's ultimate revenge for the Triple Intervention. As the fighting continues, other Western nations were becoming concerned that Japan was growing far too powerful, and Teddy Roosvelt invites Russian and Japanese diplomats to Portsmouth, NH, where they sign the treaty of the same name.

* Russia transers political and economic interests in Korea to Japan.
* Russia withdraws from Liaodong
* The Japanese split Sakhalin with Russia. (Sakhalin today has almost no Japanese culture left at all.)

The Japanese are enraged when they read about this in the papers, angry at the limited territorial gains and the lack of indemnity. On September 5, Japanese who were expecting all of Sakhalin and possibly more began to riot in Hibiya park, attacking police stations and newspaper articles. 17 are killed, over 500 are injured, 87 people were found guilty and martial law was forcefully imposed in Tokyo. Globally, there's jubilation. Indians in the British Raj, Malays in French Indochina, Africans in the European Protectorates, see in it hope that more non-white people can defeat more imperial powers. W. E. B. DuBois also cheers the striving of Japan against Europe, but quickly sours at the Japanese attempts to impose the superiority of the Japanese race.

## Local Politics

The issue central to public discourse after the Meiji constitution is signed (You missed that one after PennApps.) is the relationship between the cabinets and political parties. Yamagata Aritomo and his oligarch friends vehemently oppose political parties, and hope that people run as individuals. During the Sino-Japanese war, propoents of "responsible cabinets" in the lower house, Itagaki Taisuke of the Liberals, and Okuma Shigenobu of the Progressives, threaten to veto the budget Japan desperatley needs to fight in Russia. With its hands ties, the Imperial government agrees to allow the cretion of political parties to get war money. Shigenobu ends up winning the next election, appoints Taisuke as an advisor, and the government temporarily goes to hell. It's not that important now, but remember it, it'll be important later. In 1900, however, the Peace Police law is sucessfully passed, reenforcing the divinity of the Emperor and banning women from all public speaking about politics ever. From this point, Japan's feminist movement is all about overturning this law. In the same year, Ito Hirobumi meets with Itagaki's liberals, and they offer him the leadership of the party. Uncomfortable with the idea, Hirobumi agrees on the condition that they call it the "Friends of COnstitutional Government", not a political party. Regardless, it works like one, and Hirobumi becomes the prime minister 3 more times. For the most part, the political elite is descended from the Satsuma and Choushu families, especially those based in a prefecture called Yamaguchi, which, to today, is where most Prime Ministers come from, including the present prime minister, Shinzo Abe. In 1910, Hara Kei becomes the first prime minister from the ranks of the commoners. (Although he is of Samurai background) Disturbed at the emergence of illegal unions, he's staunchly anti-labor and glorifies the Crown Prince (A guy called Hirohito; you might have heard of him). He's ultimatley assasinated.

## The Colonization of Asia

The Japanese march into Seoul, forcibly ocupying Korea and claiming that they're there to protect Korea's soverignety. Tokyo acknowledges the Korean monarchy, even proposing intermarriage of noble family. The Japanese presence is far less popular than intended, and in 1909, a Korean nationalist assasinates Ito Hirobumi in Manchuria. A furious Japan annexes the peninsula, establishing Japanese as the official language, banning Hangul, and forcing the Koreans to assume Japanese names. (All Kim's became Kaneda's, which is the subject of many jokes in Japan, even today. Get it? North Korea is poor, but they're all called Kaneda, ha ha ha.) Western powers broker agreements with Japan, whereby Japan recognizes imperial powers nearby in exchange for recognition of Korea.

## The Taisho Era

Meiji dies in 1912, causing this emperor to assume the throne until 1926. His reign is marked by meningitis, and he cannot attend Diet meetings. He's eventually replaced by Hirohito, acting as a surrogate. This period, from 1912 to 1926, is the beginning of what's called *Taisho democracy*. While the concept of democracy is still anathema to Japan, and discussion of it is illegal, a politician names Yoshino Sakuzo propagates the idea that govenment, even if it's not of the people, should still be for the people. He gains the popularity of students, who become the 新人会, a group that will later fall under Communist influence.
