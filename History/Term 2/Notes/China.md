# The War in China

OK, so missing class is just becoming a bad habit to you, is it? Now you don't get any good notes about the collapse of Taisho democracy and Japan's slide into fascism! HA HA! (Seriously, damn. I wanted to hear about that.)

We leave off where, beginning in 1930, there are ongoing acts of violence involving both civilian organizations and military factions, with high profile assasinations occuring nearly every month. The Japanese call this period of instability the "dark valley". In March of 1931, the 桜会, a group of junior army officers, promoted the idea of a "Showa Restoration" along the lines of the Meiji one, where power would be put back in the hands of the Emperor from Meiji oligarchs and *zaibatsu*. Led by Lieutenant Hashimoto Kingorou, they advocate a new form of "state socialism". After Hamaguchi's assasination (YOU MISSED IT, YOU ASS), the oligarchs, including Saionji Kinmochi, a former Versailles diplomat, consider putting the Japanese war minister as a new prime minister. Furious when this doesn't happen, the 桜会 choose to install him via a coup. WHen this fails, the war minister, Ugaki Kashizuke, hushes it up. Really honorable behavior, there. Soon thereafter, the Japanese military in Manchuria becomes involved in what will kick off an international crisis.

## Manchukuo

You know what this is! This is where China starts to feel the burn.

### The Mukden Incident

In September 1931, Japanese Kwangtung officers acting on their own in Manchuria, under the command of Ishiwara Kanji, provoke a confrontation with Chinese forces. Recall that earlier, the Japanese had assasinated the father of Zhang Xueliang, a Chinese officer who took revenge by joining the Kuomintan. After meeting Chiang Kai-Shek in Nanking, he agrees to help the KMT regain control of Manchuria. Japanese forces attempt to provoke the KMT by blowing up bridges and opening fire. When the KMT responds, the Japanese further militarizes Manchuria. Chiang Kai-Shek protests to the League of Nations, which sends Japan an angry letter saying that it's their fault. Oooh, scary. Japan then quits the League of Nations. Not a good sign. They then force-found Manchukuo. Again, a bad sign.

### The October Incident

Our 桜会 friends are at it again! This time, they plan to assasinate the cabinet, kidnap the emperor, and blow up the Diet. At the last minute, Araki withdraws from the plot and turns in its leaders to the Kempeitai. Hashimoto is lightly sentenced to 20 day house arrest and again, the plot is covered up. Nice going, Kempeitai.

### The Shanghai Incident

In January 1932, 5 Japanese Buddhist monks of a a particularly nationalist persuasion are beaten to death in Shanghai. Japan responds by tightening control and, for the first time *ever*, sending in the Zeroes, terror bombing Shanghai, including the international quarters and embasies. The Chinese respond by boycotting Japanese goods. Japan finds the loss of revenue troubling.

## The League of Blood

Under the influence of the Nichiren priest Nisshou Inoue, this league is formed of young recruits within the military and the peasantry, committed to this notion of directed assasination of government members. Originally they're seen as a joke, but then they reveal that they have, among other things, *ninja training*. Oops. They proceed to kill *zaibatsu* heads, political leaders, cabinet members, the head of the 政友会, you name it. They actually almost get Charlie Chaplin in an attempt to provoke war with Britain. They go after anyone they see as "selling out" Japan to Western powers. This League of Blood eventually works; following Japan's withdrawl from the league, the assasinations cause immense public support and pressure to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty, which is eventually scrapped in 1934.

## The Aizawa Incident and August 12 Incident

In August 1935, a Japanese officer, Nagata Tenzan, a member of the "control" faction and Education Minister, is assasinated by Saburo Aizawa, a member of the Imperial Way faction who had previously controlled it. Aizawa is court-martialled, denied seppuku, and kille dby firing squad. Later, on Feburary 12, pro Imperial factioners sieze downtown Tokyo, seize the War Minister's home and urge him to overthrow the government, stablilize the nation and build up the army. The Minister goes to Hirohito and says that the rebels have made their demands. Hirohito tells him to get out. Araki Sadao then tells the rebels that their motives are understandable, and that all the Supreme War Councillors will support the rebels, but ultimatley things rest with the Emperor. The rebels then demand no force to be used against them, the arrest of control factionners, the appointment ot Araki Sadao as the new Kwangtung commender in Manchuria, and all steps taken to restore the emperor.

In response, Hirohito claims the rebels are "pulling a silk rope around his neck", signing an edict to supress the "rebels" and declaring martial law. Finally a legal case is brought against those who advocate for the killing, and 56 are found guilty, of which 19 are killed. Sadao retires and becomes the... Education Minister, right where things started. This, ironically enough, cements the Control faction over the Education system. Don't be fooled by the name, their leader is Hideki Tojo.

Not long after this, in 1936, the Imperial Way faction signs an agreement with Nazi Germany, condemning Communism, pledging cooperation if the USSR attacks first, and both agree to never make an agreement with the USSR. Germany recognizes Manchukuo, and then... makes the Nazi-Soviet Non Agression Pact. Man, Nazis are bastards, aren't they?

## The Xian Incident

Meanwhile, back in China, Zhang Xueilang takes Chiang Kai-Shek and puts him under house arrest, demanding that the KMT ally with Mao's Red Army in a combined effort to push the Japanese out. THe first period of the United Front, facilitated by Soviet aid to the KMT, begins in 1923 and lasts until 1927. This is well timed, as the Xian incident happens with a routine Japanese bridge-bombing to piss the Chinese off. On the ground, there are around 10,000 Japanese troops, an exchange of fire, causing Japan to lock down huge parts of China, kicking off...

### The Second Sino-Japanese War

Japan basically curb-stomps China, taking Shanghai in brutal urban warfare and costing the Chinese up to 10,000 lives. Having taken control of the international port city, and being on friendly terms with the Nazis, Japan accepted Jewish refugees, welcoming them to Shanghai. The Nazis demand the Japanese turn over the Jews to the German embassy, and senior diplomats *personally* tell Himmler to fuck off and that "Japan does not agree with your treatment of the Jews". Now, before you start thinking the Japanese are the best...

### The Rape of Nanking

Japanese troops enter the Chinese capital in 1937, and depending on who you ask, kill anywhere from 40,000 to 300,000 Chinese. (Or 0, if you ask Japan) There are truly hideous images of rapes, beheadings, massacres, mass graves, rapes, butchering, dismemberment, you name it. The US is outraged, and Roosevelt calls for a "moral embargo" against Japan. Unfortunatley, Japan is too important to our economy at this point for us to do anything. Regardless, the US imposes sanctions on petroleum, scrap iron and bank accounts.
