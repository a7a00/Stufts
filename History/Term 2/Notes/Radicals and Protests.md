# The 1960's and '70s

Last week, we talked about Sato Eisaku, who was the head of MITI and moved on to become the Prime Minister. Cooperating with us in Vietnam, signing a treaty with South Korea, and overseeing the return of Okinawa, he draws controversy for cooperating with us, but is widely praised for normalizing relations with Korea.He also signs the pledge that Japan will never build, host or sell nukes. (They end up breaking this for us. Thanks, guys!) Lastly, he returns the Japanese holiday to February 11, where it remains to this day.

## The Beatles

Following the Olympics, the Beatles arrive in July 1966 to perform in Tokyo. However, in an anti-US political climate, there were small protests. Compounding the fact was that they were set to preform in the *Budoukan*, Japan's massive martial arts stadium. In angry response, Yomiuri Shinbun tries to pull out of sponsoring the concert, but can't. 35,000 police are called out to protect the Beatles for planned protests on request from the British Embassy. But, there was a force on the other way that no one could have seen.

*They. Were. The. Beatles.*

To this day, Japan is the world's most Beatles-obsessed country.

In addition, the first Nobel Prize in literature is awarded to a Japanese, Kawabata Yasunari.

## The Vietnam War and Protests

Throughout the '60s, this war colors the background of all US-Japan relations, and helps make Japan even richer. In 1945, the surrendering Japanese give power to the Vietnamese emperor Bao Dai, who wasn't the strongest candidate and quickly becomes irrelevant, resulting in a civil war between the Communist Vietminh and returning French troops. We pay 80% of the French war budget to prevent a Communist victory. Of course, you know what happens in Dien-Bien Phu. Vietnam is divided much like Korea, between a Communist north and a Democratic south. In the South, President Ngo Dinh Diem cancels elections and uses his US backing to set up a dictatorship, knowing we can't do shit against him when Ho Chi Minh has 80% of the Vietnamese vote. We support the South, the Communists support the North, and the North Koreans make life nasty for us by providing a shit ton of aid to saboteurs in the south. Of course, you know what happens in the Vietnam war, and we withdraw in 1973. Saigon falls to Charlie in 1975.

THere are no real victors in the Vietnam War, but Japan does really well through more "special procurements". In '66 alone, more than half a billion dollars worth of contracts are signed with various *zaibatsu*. In 1968, Tokyo University students raid armories, arm themselves with guns and armor, and occupy the university, shutting it down for a year. At the same time, professors and students accross Japan, with a lot of help from MIT, for peace coalition. The National Students' League becomes militant and radical, openly using riot gear, helmets, guns and nightsticks.

## Protests and Radicals

There were also huge protests regarding the opening of Narita. Farmers begin to protest in 1965, riots over expropriations kill 3 policemen in 1971, and in 1978, protestors smash a completed terminal building to bits, destroying half a million dollars in property. On Opening Day, 6,000 protestors go up against 14,000 police. Narita is also very, very far from Tokyo. The train is fast, but 41 miles is nothing to sneeze at.

### Far Left

Further riots erput in Okinawa when a drunken US service man is heckled near a red light district. Up to 60 US soldiers are injured and 21 Okinawans are arested.

Shigenobu Fusako, originally a Japanese Communist, splits off into a radical and violent faction, calling itself the United Red Army. In 1971, this group makes headlines after 12 members are killed by comrades in an alpine retreat. She later founds the Japan Red Army in Lebanon, condemns the violence at the retreat, and pledges herself to Palestinian liberation. She was arrested on return to Japan in 2000, but still is culturally influential, writing music. In 1970, a faction of a Red Army hijacks a Japanese plane, kicks the passengers off, and flies to North Korea, where they are granted asylum and given jobs as language instructor.

In 1972, 3 members of the Japanese Red Army kill 24 people in Israel's Lod Airport.

### Far Right

Well known novelist Mishima Yukio, having attained a huge reputation as apotential Nobel Prize recipent, completes the 4th colume of his final work in November 1970, and proceeds to calmly put down his pen, walk to the Jietai headquarters and take control of the building. He then dresses in a high school uniform, (Japan is weird) and tries to incite a coup among the recruits. The recruits think it's hilarious. Having failed, he does what any crazy Japanese person would do and, on live TV...

Apparently the recruits think this is *really* hilarious.

The reaction among the watchers on TV is mostly stunned silence. Some revere the Japanese spirit he shows. Others are just confused.
