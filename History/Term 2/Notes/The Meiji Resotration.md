# Rename

We left off with the assassination of Ii Naosuke, and a lot of stuff starts happening very quickly. In order to rebuild relationships between the *daimyo* and the court, *sankin koutai* is abolished, and the emperor's sister marries the Shogun. Not super helpful, but essentially all the shogun could do. The shogunate also sends an official, Fukuzawa Yukichi, to to US, and he's nor particularly impressed, wondering why Christianity exists, and questioning San Fransisco's "lack of any Western technology". In the meantime, the Richardson affair is boiling over. Tokugawa Yoshinobu is released from house arrest and given a civil position. Emperor Komei then issues the first Imperial decree in *centuries*, ordering "expulsion of the barbarians". Choushu happily starts firing on Western vessels in 1863, and the British bomb Kagoshima flat in retaliation. The French and the US join in, too, and bomb the crap out of Shimonoseki. As the US draws away due to the Civil War, England starts getting more involved. The shogunate declares Choushu a "rebellious state". This all boils over into the...

## Hamaguri Gate Rebellion & Choushu Wars

Also known as the Kinmon incident, this attempted coup involved Choushu, Aizu, Owati, Mito and Kii samurai attempting to take control of the city and Imperial palace. They are defeated from within by the *ninja* and samurai of the shogunate, and return to Choushu. Choushu is then invaded by Satsuman forces, and a lot of the leaders end up doing what we'd expect.

But, one year later, Choushu starts rebelling again, and not even the Shogunate combined with the French Navy can defeat them. Satsuma says "screw this, we're not helping you" to the Shogunate.

## A Shift in Values

You'll remember that the idea of "Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians", is a central idea to many people, and it's a religious one. But, in the 1860's, many rebels get a different idea. "Enrich the Country, Strengthen our Military". THe Emperor must not be revered, but installed. The Shogunate must not be criticized, but overthrown. The West must not be thrown out, but learned from.

Iemochi dies, and Yoshinobu *finally* becomes Shogun, but at this time, Satsuma, Choushu, Tosa and Hizen have formed a Western Allaiance. Against this background, 2 things start happening:

* Emperor Komei dies and his son Mutsuhito (the future Emperor Meiji) ascends to the throne.
* Peasant uprising go through the roof.

The first one isn't important *yet*, but the second one is wreaking havoc with the Japanese economy, and Osaka regularly shuts down for massive Mardi Gras-style parties because the peasants feel like it. And then, very quickly, it all boils over.

**THE SHOGUN STEPS DOWN.**

THat's right. It's over. The Shogunate, 250 uninterrupted years, is over. But Yoshinobu has no attempt of giving up power. Japanese people, if you'll remember, like to rule from the shadows after thy've stepped down. And the Imperial forces don't like it one bit.

## The Boshin War

The first battle between shogunal and Imperial forces is a disaster for the shogunate. Many shogunal samurai see they're raising swords against Imperial banners, and...

FIghting rages up and down Japan, and the Shogun's forces are routed up and down the country. In the middle of the war, Meiji and his samurai pledge open votes, and common decisions, jobs open to all, fewer class distinctions, and a search for worldwide knowledge. There's also a "disavowal of evil customs of the past", such as mixed-sex bathing, teeth blackening, etc, and an intention to follow "natural law". The Shogunate's last stand is at a Western-style star fort (seriously, it looks like something out of the Civil War) in Hakodate, and Yoshinobu surrenders, is put under house arrest, and then pardoned.

### The Republic of Ezo

Inspired by events down south, Hokkaido tries to found its own country with an American-style constitution. It doesn't really work.

## The Meiji Restoration

And you thought things were moving fast before! The era starts with an Imperial decree that the names of ages are no longer open to interpretation. It's the Emperor in charge that determines the age. So far there have been 4 of these periods.

* Meiji - Mutsuhito
* Taisho - Masahito
* Showa - Hirohito
* Heisei - Akihito

In addition to the Japanese calendar, the Western solar calendar is adopted.

江戸 is renamed to 東京 and moved 20 or so miles to the west. The Emperor moved to the Shogunal palace to be in the capital, and moves his loyal followers there as well, including many generals from the Boshin war.

### The 太政官

This "great political body" was actually a structure from the 8th Century, but Meiji decides to bring it back. Alongside this structure, there's an equally powerful religious arm. Thing is, since Japan is on a nativist kick, it's a shinto religious arm. What follows is the mass smelting of temple bells for bronze, and the burning of sutras, and this is ignored on purpose. *Shinto* preaches that the emperor is divine and must be obeyed. As a result, it's the only religion that can exist. State Shinto is a very powerful tool for the government, and getting rid of it will be one of the hardest challenges for us in 1945. In this process, 18,000 temples are destroyed.

### New Class Structures

In 1869, a new class structure is created. At the top of society are the *kazoku*, former nobles and *daimyo*. Underneath them are the *Shizoku*, high level samurai recieving stipends from their lords. Under them are the *sotsu*, or standing foot soldiers. Under them are the *heimin*, or everyone else, about 93% of the population. But very quickly, these classes start falling to common status. Stipends are taxed, and the Bank of Japan starts offering savings bonds instead. And in 1876, these bonds become mandatory. Sword wearing is fully banned except for soldiers and policemenm and the *chonmage*, that funny samurai hairstyle, is banned. Samurai income collapses from 10% to 75%, and the samurai class begins to disappear.

### Yasukuni Shrine

This was originally a shrine to soldiers in the Boshin War, but 2.46 million are enshrined there today, including the 1,068 war criminals that China is furious at. As a result, Abe loves to visit it. There's also a museum about how totally amazing Japan was in World War 2, and how Nanking was actually the Chinese' fault and wasn't even that bad. (It's Japan. Are you surprised?)

So is this a revolution? A few scholars say yes. A few say no, that it was a partial revolution lead by *samurai* who later dissolve themselves.
