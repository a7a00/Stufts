OK, you came in late. Here's what you missed:

* Japanese immigrants flood Hawaii
* There's a treaty signed with China in 1781. They will be "forever equal". (HA HA HA)

Some background, Japan demands tribute from China after a bunch of Japanese and Ruykan sailors were killed by Taiwanese nations. China says Taiwan is outside its control, but Ryukyu is, so get the hell off it. The US urges Japan to take action, and led by Takamori's (the Korea nut) brother, Japan invades Taiwan. 3600 Japanese troops kill 30 civilians to make a point, and then demand China pay up for mission costs. When England forces China to pay up, it becomes clear that the Qing had no control over Taiwan and Japan owned Ryukyu.

Once Ryukyu is transferred from a feudal barony to a prefecture, the King of Ryukyu is formally invited to Japan, where he becomes part of the nobility.

## The Kuril Islands

In 1855, Japan controlled the 4 northern Kurils under the Shimoda Treaty with Russia. Both aggreed to joint settlement of Sakhalin with no clear border. In 1875, the Russians grab all of Sakhalin and the Japanese grab all the Kurils because apparently the old arrangement was too confusing.

## Korea

If you'll remember, the Koreans had no interest in foreign trade and forwarded all diplomats to China. In 1871, a Japanese mission is violently turned away in what became known as the Un'yo incident. This produces the debate we discusses last week. In 1873, when the Iwakura mission hears of it, this is scrapped, but after another issue, there's a treaty signed between Japan and Korea on Kangawon Island, near what will become the DMZ. This treaty is modeled after the unequal treaties Japan herself had endured:

* Korea is independent, and is not a tribute of anybody.
* Envoys are exchanged every 15 months.
* Japanese will be used in all correspondence. Chinese will do in a pinch. No Korean.
* Korea has to cough up enormous unfair tariff rates.
* 3 ports to be opened by 1877.
* Aid for Japanese ships
* The Japanese can survey the coast
* Tsushima now belongs to Japan
* Japanese mechants in Korea can't be taxed.
* Extraterritoriality/Most Favored Nation clauses

This really pisses the Koreans off, but they face a problem Korea faces today-a super divided government. There's the king's father, minister Daewongun, who hates the Japanese, Queen Min, who wants trade with Japan, and King Kojong, caught between them.

### Kim Ok-Gyun

No, probably no relation. Of aristocratic background, he initially opposed the Kangawon Treaty, but recieves a Western education in Japan and comes to the conclusion that the government needs to be overthrown. This will be important later.

### Imo Mutiny

Japanese soldiers are brought to Seoul to train the Korean Army. In 1882, furious soldiers, now with training by the Japanese, riot. We're not sure if it's lack of wages or the fact that the trainers treated the Koreans like dogs, but for whatever reason, a lot of Japanese trainers are killed. Daewongun supports the rebels, so when China arrives to put them down, they arrest him and send him to Taiwan. So we know that the Japanese are already causing problems.

### The Sino-French War

In the background of Japanese Korean relations is the fact the the Koreans support the Chinese here, and the Japanese support France. This is rountinely the subject of problems.

### Kapsin Rebellion & The Tianjin Convention

Furious at the government, 2 men named Kim Ok-gyun and Paek Yong-hyo attempt a violent coup. In this chaos, 40 Japanese are killed, the legation is burned, Japanese officials flee back to Japan, and Queen Min does what Korea always seems to do at this time. (And what North Korea still does) She calls in the Chinese, and General Yuan Shikai forcibly restores order.

In response to this, Ito Hirobumi and Li Hongzhang sign the Tianjin convention, where both sides agree to demilitarize Korea, not train any troops and not send anyone in without consulting the other side. And this works, providing peace for 10 years or so.

## Freedom and Popular Rights

Following the samurai leaving the government in protest, several founded sepearate political movements. Itagaki, from last week, called a "chameleon" by E.H. Norman, issues a motion to the Emperor on the establishment on the establishment of a representative assebly in 1874. That frightened the nobility enough to invite him back into the government to shut him up. They establish the 元老院, which is basically an oligarchy. This is super-conservative and marginalizes Itagaki's views, so he bails and founds Japan's first political party in less than a year. In 1875, Meiji realizes the threat and promises some sort of constitution. But he also institutes the censorship laws so people don't get too comfortable.

## Ex-Samurai Uprisings

In response to these new changes, rebellions rise up everywhere.

### Saga

In 1874, an ex-samurai robs a bank for money and siezes Saga castle, declaring his prefecture in revolt. The home minister catches him, and denies him seppuku, eventually hanging a picture of the samurai's head on his office wall.

..Not creepy at all.

### Jinpuren

In Kyushu, a Shinto priest claims that his followers are immune to bullets. We all know how that works out. 124 samurai are killed, and the remaining 200...

### Akizuki

400 Ex-samurai upset about Westernization kill an on-duty police officer and try to rise up. The police force sends in shock troops to stop them, they all kill themselves, and they're revered as heroes of Fukuoka even to today. The Japanese are weird.

### Satsuma

In 1874, Saigo Takamori sets up a military academy, but by 1877, seeing him preach anti-government propaganda and hoarding weapons, Meiji sends troops in. Once fighting inevitably breaks out, Yamagata Aritomo sends in forces to crush the uprising. Takamori joins in to lead his students and former men. They march on and besiege Kumamoto castle, but are driven back by well trained peasant conscripts. By August, only 3,000 combatants out of his 20,000 are left. I think we know what happens to Takamori.

This comes at a huge cost to the regime, and Japan is forced to move off the gold standard and print money, causing deflation.

Takamori is revered today in Japan; even tough he rebelled against the empreror, he was loyal to his soldiers and friends.

There's even revolt in the Imperial Army in 1878, resulting in the execution of 53 by firing squad, and the punishment of 213 more. By Japanese standards, things are spiraling into chaos.

## The Meiji Constitution

In 1881, multiple phenomena cause Meiji to get a move on with reform. On one hand, new newspapers reveal that, in order to rectify finances, the Imperial government is going to sell state-owned properties in Hokkaido. These assets were to be transferred to the beginnings of the *zaibatsu*. There are 4 main families that stand to benefit.

* Mitsui (These people were the inspiration for the Kiryuuins in *Kill La Kill*. Let that sink in. They also own Sony and Toshiba.)
* Sumitomo (Inspiration for the Takaradas. Today own everything from Panasonic to JAXA's rockets.)
* Mitsubishi
* Yasuda-Yamaha

These should all sound *very* familiar. The Sumitomo largely occumy the South of Japan, while the Mitsui occupy the north. Where have we seen that before?

In response to the outrage caused by this, there's a tour to study the world's constitutions and introdce democracy to Japan.
