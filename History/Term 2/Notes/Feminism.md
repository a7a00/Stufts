# Feminism in Taisho Japan

OK, so you missed the 2 lectures due to illness, but we still seem to be in the middle of the Taisho political crisis. Weird. Anyhow, the author of the *Factory Ship* is killed by the special police. His collleague, Kawakami Hajime, is a leading economic professor in Kyoto. He was a Christian, became a Zen practicioner, and ended up as a Marxist, translating all 3 volumes of *Das Kapital* before they were even available in English. Hajime is arrested for membership in the Communist Party, and is released after 4 years.

## The Koza-Rono Debate

In the late 1920's, a debate rose up between the "Lecture" faction, mostly Communist party members, and the Rono, or Farmer-Labor party. The Lecture faction claimed that feudalism persisted in Japan even after Meiji and that a 2-stage revolution was needed. There needs to be a bourgeoise revolution before there can be a Bolshevik-style one, after all. The Rono claim that the Meiji restoration was actually a bourgeoise revolution, just one that wasn't complete yet. These 2 factions continue to exist, and our professor did research with them! One theory of the Rono was one of "petty imperialism". The argument was that since petty bourgeoise are friends with the proletariat, so is a "petty empire" like Japan naturally allied with the opporessed countries. This is totally not going to be used to get Communists to support Japanese imperialism, no, not at all why on earth would you think that.

## The Women's Movement

Western men had always been impressed by the ability of Japanese women to assume responsibility and circulate in society. In the Tokugawa period, many women had assigned roles in the house, but they were free to come and go, and since they ran the house, they were responsible for managing, shopping, going around town to manage finances and expenses, handling money, running the household economy, handling busines correspondence, and performng agricutural work. The Meiji restoration is not neccesarily an advance, as Victorian gender norms begin to arrive and clash with Japanese beliefs. Women were forbidden from adopting Western styles, and they're seen as guards of tradition. Women are expected to be "good wives and wise mothers", marrying, assisting their husband, and educating their children in fields both traditional and those taught in the new Japanese public school system. THe phrase "good wives and wise mothers" was coined by Nakamura Masanao, a COnucianist who also translated Mill and Rosseau.

There's also a general debate about prostitution. In Tokugawa Japan, there's no concept of being a bastard, and wedlock is seen as unimportant for an heir. Since marriage is so unimportant, a Shinto wedding is basically invented by the Emperor after the Meiji restoration, because he's the Emperor and a living god, and he does what he damn well wants. (Today, Christian weddings are more popular because they're fancier. Go figure.) The pleasure quarters also come under fire in the Meiji and Taisho periods. This comes to a head in 1872, when passengers jump off a Peruvian ship, claiming they were sold into slavery. When Japan orders their asylum, the Portugese captian points out that the sale of daughters into prostitution, often for life, is quite common, even in Meiji Japan, which sparks a debate. Missionaries argue fiercely, some claiming that sin is never going away and should be centally regulated, others claiming that sin should be wiped out.

### Kusunose Kita

This 45 year old land-owning widow was allowed to vote under the Shogunate, and is enraged when this right is taken away by the Meiji restoration. She publishes in almost every newspaper a letter that says that women are expected to act as citizens, pay taxes and perform civic duty, but aren't allowed to vote. Her letter is quoted incessantly.

### Kishida Toshiko

This Kyoto lady is known for her beauty and wit, and people came from miles around to hear her speak.

> "If men are to rule everyone by virtue of their strength, why do we not have a government of sumo wrestlers?"

She's silenced early on for inciting "mass unease and dissatisfaction".

### Fukuda Hideko

Disillusioned because the Liberal Party wasn't radical enough, she's arrested along with her husband and becomes a socialist radical setting up schools for women around the country.

### Yajima Kajiko

Leaving her husband behind due to alcoholism and abuse, she attends a Women's Christian Temperance Union lecture, and was so moved that she established the Tokyo Women's Reform Society, attempting to cultivate morality, and opposing prostitution, drinking and smoking. People are kind of pissed.

### Kanno Suga

Response is quick, and women are banned from voting, speaking, or attending Diet meetings. Women like Kanno respond by becoming anarchists. Kanno's life really sucked. Her mother diead at 11, her stepmother payed a man to rape her at 13, flees to Tokyo at 17, divorces, returns to Osaka and becomes the mistress of a novelist, and then becomes a journalist, getting in touch with women like Kajiko in Osaka. She has an affair with a Japanese Communist and openly advocates free love, the idea that people should have multiple partners.

> "I cannot contain my disgust on the fact that our society's most eloquent men speak brazenly on female chastity. It is incredibly insulting."

She also advocates for women to bring down the class system, and becomes involved with another prominent anarchist. She plans to bomb the Imperial Carriage, and then, at her trial, says they she'd love to kill the emperor, burn the prisons and slice Yamagata Aritomo open. She is killed. Like, really fast.

### The New Women's Assiciation

This group is far more moderate, attracting a ton of men.

### Household Registration

In the Tokugawa period, as you'll remember, people were logged and tracked as members of a Buddhist temple. With the end of the Tokugawa peiod, a new system is put in place that survives to today, a system called the 戸籍, which lists your relationship to all other members of your family. Today in Japan, you need to submit this for everything from a subway pass to a job applicatin.
