# Initial Relations

After Perry and his fellows leave, surveying Japan' coast and demanding reply upon his return to Japan, the head of the *Roju*, Masahiro Abe (at this point the most powerful man in Japan) polls the 260 *daimyo* as to what to do. This is in part a loss of face, but also an indication on the Japanese clue of seeking consensus. 50 replies have since been preserved. Of these, 34 opposed any concessions to the western barbarians. 14 responses either don't care or want a compromise. Only 2 advocated opening the country. Given the military strength of the US, Masahiro has no real choice but to sign the Convention of Kanagawa with Perry, which begins the proccess of opening the country.

The official document indicates that not all the demands can be met, officially due to the death of the *shogun* Ieyoshi and the acession of his successor Iesada. However, Japan does agree to open one port, and supply coal, water and maritime aid. Following this, there's a railroad display and a minstrel show. The blackface left a huge impact on the Japanese, many of whom were shocked. Beer is also brought in by the caseload, which makes the Japanese very happy. The 2 ports that are opened are deliberatley far from Edo, Shimoda and Hakodate. Townsend Harris is sent to negotiate at Shimoda.

## Tokugawa Nariaki

Related to the *shogun*, this *daimyo* of Mito Domain (now suburbs of Tokyo) was an avid proponent of the *mitogaku* school of thought. You'll remember from last term that this is an offshoot of 国学. Like all other schools, it backs the emperor to death, but also has an enormous respect from Confucianism and Eurpoean science. However, the central tenet always remains "revere the emperor, expel the barbarians". He's joined in his opposition by Satsuma and Choushu, both led by *tozama daimyo*, who, as you'll remember, wield less influence. Mito, on the other hand, is run by the a Tokugawa, and is thus very influential.

## More Negotitions

Abe eventually steps down, leaving another official, Hotta Masayoshi, to talk with Townsend Harris, a veteran merchant with lots of experience working in China. He was appointed by Franklin Pierce as the envoy to Japan along with his Dutch translator Henrik Heusken. The two of them are assigned lodging in Shimoda and placed under constant surveillance. Harris was also known to demand prostitutes. A lot. Since Shimoda has no prostitues, there are a ton of records of Harris demanding so incessantly that the Japanese hire a teenage lounge singer into Harris' service, basically to get Harris to shut up. She was rejected by him because of some sort of skin condition. So guess what happens?

YAY! WE'RE BACK IN ACTION!

Prostitute suicide aside, the US emphasizes free trade's benefits. When Japan protests and claims an outflow of silver is imminent, the US points out that China is surrently getting its ass handed to it in the Second Opium War. Afraid of England, Japan agrees to some successions.

### The Treaty of Amity and Friendship

The first clause of this treaty stipulates "permanant friendship" between Japan and the US. (Ha, ha, ha) The ports of Niigata, Kanazawa and Kobe are open, Shimoda will close. US citizens will be free to live in Edo and Osaka, and will be allowed to practice Christianity, so long as they do it in complete privacy. A schedule of tariffs is applied (which was somewhat unfair for the Japanese), and the importation of opium is banned. Japan must give all privleges afforded to other nations to us, and extralegal consular courts are set up. US citizens are to be tried under US laws, and may not enter the Japanese justice system. The treaty also authorizes Japan to buy military hardware from us and employ US citizen. Either side can choose to end the treaty with a year's notice, starting in 1875.

Hotta does something very unorthodox now, and goes to Kyoto to get the approval of the Empror Komei. Komei responds by saying that the treaty is bullshit and will spell the doom of Japan. Not the best start. It's also not the best start that upon the signing of the treaty, roughly $23,000,000 of gold immediatley leave the country. This causes the value of silver to tank to the international standard, and plunges wage laborers into poverty. Certain products that were popular domestically are diverted overseas. Rice, silk, tea and sake experience a price boom, and the cost of living skyrockets.

Other treaties follow, and Holland, Russia, Britain and France all sign similar treaties.

## The *Ansei* Purge and Yoshida Shouin

The *shogun* Iesada dies without an heir, causing a split. Those who oppose the treaty want Nariaki's son Yoshinobu in charge. Instead, power goes to a cousin, Iemochi. Yoshinobu and his father are placed under house arrest, and Hotta's successor, Ii Naosuke, is given temporary dictatorial powers. Like all good dictators, he initiates a purge, arresting over 100, including Nariaki. There are also severla executions, including that of Yoshida Shouin, a Choushu scholar, originally a *samurai* who deserted to study Western science. He opened a military academy based on Confucian tenets and Western military discipline, as well as 国学. Not only did he accept *samurai*, but also commoners. This is the beginning of the Japanese army. Not surprisingly, one of his chief students, Yamagata Aritomo, will eventually dissolve the *samurai* class. He also tried to stow away with Matthew Perry. Following his failed assasination of Ii Naosuke, he is arrested, and denied the right to seppuku. He is executed.

### *Shishi*

People in lower levels of society, furious as its opening and subsequent turmoil, begin to form these bands of "men of high purpose". These are basically terrorist cells, attacking foreigners and politicians. Heusken is killed by these people, as are several British officials (who admittedly rode into the middle of the Satsuma *daimyo*), and blow up the US consulate.

Eventually, Ii Naosuke is ambushed by a combination of Satsuma and Mito *samurai*, and is killed. See, who says that *tozama* and *shinpan* samurai can't work together once every hundred years or so?
