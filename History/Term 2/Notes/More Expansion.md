# More Expansion & Militarization

Yeah, you slept through last lecture, so read up on the Meiji Constitution.

Anyhow, there's a tremendous historical emphasis on Japan's Westernization, but a central idea of it is how quickly Japan industrialized. The people of Japan had been accustomed to the idea of wage and day labor long before the machines arrived, and this allowed Japan to very quickly industrialize. Unlike England, which moved from farmers to laborers somewhat uncomfortably, the urban workers you remember from last term had no problems putting down the wood looms and picking up the wrenches. (Hell, it was what they were all ready used to!)

## Honored Foreign Workers

The Meiji oligarchs had shifted from *sonno-joi* to *fukoku kyouhei*, meaning "Prosperous country, strong armies". In order to reach maximum production, Japanese oligarchs and new business magnates focused on their advantages. And one of Japan's biggest advantage was silk. In the 1860's, there was an enormous silk blight in Italy and France, and Japan was the only nation capable of filling in demand. Harnessing the power of thousands upon thousands of teenage girls, Japan makes enough money to invest in steel production, industry, mills, and of course building up a naval force. Foreign advisors for these projects were highly paid, (over 1/3 of the national budget, over 800 employed) and often remained in Japan once their employment was done to become university professors. Men like William Smith Clark came to Japan to found Hokkaido Uniersity and exhort Japanese men to "be ambitious!", architechts like Josiah Condor come from England to design things like the "Deer Cry Hall", and American anthropologists discover the Yayoi. French merchants bring the Jacquard loom and steam power to silk mills accross Japan (especially in Tomioka). Japanese girls like Wada Ei (of samurai background) work there by the hundreds. Ei writes about how intimidating it is to work in a Western factory, but she soldiers on, and for most of the Meiji period, half of the workforce is female.

## *Zaibatsu* and Capitalism

We know what this is! Literally a "financial clique". We've talked about the Mitsui, the Sumitomo, the Mistsubishi, the Yasuda. These go *way* back; Mitsui was a massive dry goods chain with over 200 locations and its own consumer credit by the middle of the Edo period. The Sumitomo get their start in mining, the Mitsubishi is founded by a samurai who wants to get into shipbuilding. Last but not least, the Yasuda, who get their start in banking. While it's the least important, the founder's granddaughter would go on to marry John Lennon. Zaibatsu are set up much the way they are now. The family is in charge, and dominates a "Holding Company", which then owns subsidiaries, manufacturing concerns, in-house banks, metallurgy, textiles, naval industry, you name it.

### Shibusawa Eiishi

This "father of Japanese capitalism" helps found the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, and sets up the Tokyo Stock Exchange. An entepreneur and venture capitalist, he preaches the virtue of conduxting business for the honor and prestige of Japan. This intertwining of Japanese *samurai* culture and modern capitalism gives us Japan's very interesting corporate culture. Plus, Japanese CEO's continue to take home only 2-3 times their employees salaries.

## Imperialism - The Beginnings

Yeah, this is gonna get kinda dark really fast. Lenin said that a capitalist country, when it gets to a certain point, needs to expand to new markets. And denied of them, it needs to seize these markets by force. And given that Japan is accelerating through the stages of capitalism at breakneck speed, it looks like we're going to smash right into it. But Japan doesn't has a surplus of capital when it strikes out on the warpath at all. If this theory was fully accurate, Japan wouldn't expand until much later. But in the rush to emulate Western Imperial powers, Japan jumps right in. And things start going really bad for Japan's neighbors.

## First Sino-Japanese War

Fought in 1894, this war is caused by a peasant rebellion that opposed the regime in Korea. When the rebellion breaks out, Korea calls in China, and Japan says, under the Tianjin agreement, they should have been notified. China basically tells Japan to suck it, and Japan invades Korea, taking the fight to Chinese forces stationed in Korea. The episode is glorified, and Japanese forces BTFO out the Chinese and Koreans, marching down the streets of Pyongyang and creating a parade route that will eventually become Kim Il-Sung avenue, still the site of military parades today. Utterly humiliated, the Chinese sue for peace, and Japan annexes Taiwan. Japan takes the ethnically diverse Taiwan, long ignored by the Qing dynasty, and establish an education syystem and a central government. The Japanese send representatives to colonies accross the world and emulate British traditions from India and French ideas from Africa.

### Liaodong

Did you just say China? And did you just say dong? The Treaty of Shimonoseki, which solidifies this, also gives Japan industrial rights on the Liaodong Peninsula, an area in Manchuria. But no sooner do forces arive then Russia (wanting a warm water port) France (wanting Chinese money) and Germany (Wanting a sphere of influence) tell Japan to back off. A very angry Japan sells Liaodong back to China, forcing them to pay more on top of the indemnity they've already paid. 2 years later, Germany grabs the nearby territory of Shandong (and founds Tsingtao!) which makes Japan annoyed at a percieved double standard.

### The Boxer Rebellion

The Boxers totally rip off *sonno-joi*, calling for Boxers to "revere the emperor, expel the foreigner". Cixi, as you know, vaccilates, supporting the rebels, and standing by as the foreign embassies are besieged. As you know, 8 nations form an allaiance, and kicks serious tail. Chief among these nations is Japan, committing huge numbers of troops to the fight, engaging in no rapes (yet) and impressing Western powers. Japan revieves 7.7% of the spoils, chanelling it into military production, and becomes a member of the imperialist club dividing up China. In 1902, England establishes an equal treaty with Japan, the first of its time.

## Russo-Japanese War

After denying Japan the rights to Liaodong, Russia grabs it after the Boxer Rebellion, pissing off Japan, as well as scaring it. So Japan poses a compromise with Russia, but Russia refuses to disarm, massing troops in Manchuria and competing for influence in Korea. Things come to a head on February 8th, but we're out of time! See you Wednesday!
