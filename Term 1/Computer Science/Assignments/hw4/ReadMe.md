# ReadMe for COMP 15 HW4 - Binary Search Tree Assignment 

This program creates a simple binary search tree, with functionality for adding and removing elements.

## Files

`main.cpp` - Initial tests
`BinarySearchTree.cpp` - Tree functionality
`BinarySearchTree.h` - Header file for `BinarySearchTree.cpp`
`pretty_print.cpp` - Outputs test results in a readable format
`Makefile` - For compiling

## Compiling

Use the included makefile with no flags.

## Structure Used
