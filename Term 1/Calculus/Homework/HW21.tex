\title{Homework 21: Alternating Series}


\author{Alexander Gould, Section 3}

\maketitle
\textbf{Determine whether the following series converge.}

11. Nuke the alternator of $\sum\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k^{3}}$ and we
get $\frac{1}{k^{3}}$, which decreases to 0. Therefore this sum converges.

12. Exactly the same as \#11. Get rid of the alternator $\sum\frac{(-1)^{k}}{k^{2}+10}$
and take the limit of $\frac{1}{k^{2}}$ once the constant goes away
and the series converges.

13. The alternator of $\sum(-1)^{k+1}\frac{k^{2}}{k^{3}+1}$ is already
separated for us. When we remove the constant and take the limit of
$\frac{k^{2}}{k^{3}}$, we see it decreases to 0 and the series converges.

14. Same here. $\sum(-1)^{k}\frac{\ln k}{k^{2}}$ becomes $\frac{\ln k}{k^{2}}$,
which increases to 0 as the denominator overpowers the numerator,
so the series converges.

15. Killing the alternator, getting rid of the constants and taking
the limit of $\frac{k^{2}}{k^{2}}$ gets us 1, not 0, which means
the series diverges.

16. Getting rid of the alternator here gives us the limit of $\frac{1}{5}^{k}$,
which decreases to 0, and the series converges.

17. Another easy alternator removal. Take the limit of $1+\frac{1}{k}$,
limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, and we converge to 1, so
the series doesn't converge.

18. We can't just take the alternator out, but we can see that the
numerator endlessly alternates, so we can just get rid of it like
it's a standard alternator. $\frac{1}{k^{2}}$ goes to 0, so the series
converges.

20. Knock the alternator out of $\sum\frac{(-1)^{k}}{k\ln^{2}k}$
and we get $\frac{1}{k\ln^{2}k}$, which approaches 0, so the series
converges.

23. Knock out the alternator again and take the limit of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^{2}+4}}$,
which goes to 0, so the series converges.
