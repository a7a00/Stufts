# The Integral Test

Given ![1](../res/Lesson\ 2/1.gif), let ![2](../res/Lesson\ 2/2.gif) equal the series terms. If ![2](../res/Lesson\ 2/2.gif) is continuous, positive and eventually decreasing, ![1](../res/Lesson\ 2/1.gif) and the integral of ![2](../res/Lesson\ 2/2.gif) to infinity behave the same way.

## Example

If we take ![4](../res/Lesson\ 2/4.gif) we ned to show that ![2](../res/Lesson\ 2/2.gif) is continuous and positive from 1 to infinity.

![5](../res/Lesson\ 2/5.gif), so we know that it diverges.

## P Series

This rule is insanely simple. If we have ![6](../res/Lesson\ 2/6.gif), it converges if *p* is greater than 1 and diverges otherwise.

Now say we end up with something nasty like ![7](../res/Lesson\ 2/7.gif). We know it's a positive series, so we go ahead and use the integral test. ![2](../res/Lesson\ 2/2.gif) is just the summed term, so we need to show that it's both continuous and positive from 2 up and show that it eventually decreases. Since ![2](../res/Lesson\ 2/2.gif) has a negative derivative. I lost track of my notes here...
