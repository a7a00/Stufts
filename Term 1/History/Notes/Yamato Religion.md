# Religion in Yamato Japan

## More Buddhism

Buddhist monasticism heavily emphasized proper speech and thought, but wasn't all that specific, which resulted in a number of splits and councils regarding what the Buddhist way and enlightenment meant. By the 1st century BC, Buddhism has split into the *Mahayana*, those with a greater view of what enlightenment was, and some other sects.

### *Mahayana* Buddhism

* A greater role of the laypeople in worship and services
* Concept of the *Bodhisattva*, people who attain enlightenment and remain to answer prayers, similar to saints
* Spreads through the north of Asia
  * Travels the Silk Road through northern China
  * Transfers via maritime routes to southern China

*Mahayana* arrives in Koryo controlled territory in around 372. At this time, Koryo was a massive kingdom witht he ability to force the religion to Paekje, across the Tsushima Strait, when it reaches Japan, hitting up against...

## 神道

*Shinto* is the worship of *kami*, hundreds of thousands of not neccesarily benevolent spirits, inhabiting rocks streams, feelings, the sun, etc. (And in modern times, robots!) *Shinto* heavily emphasizes purity through bathing, not touching blood, wearing indoor slippers, etc. There's a heavy emphasis on festivals surrounding shrines where these spirits live.

Some key features of *Shinto* that make things interesting:
* There's a concern for practical benefits
* No real moral code in place

This, as you can imagine, put the two religions somewhat at odds.

### 神道 and Buddhism

The Japanese emperor of the time was thrilled and said the doctrine was amazing, but that Japan was not yet at a point where the state religion could be changed that easily. At a council, certain ministers (especially those in charge of tax collection) advocated for the adoption of Buddhism. However, other clans (such as those in charge of the military and priestly activities) disagreed, arguing that people would incur the wrath of the Japanese national gods. The emperor entrusts the Soga clan with the Buddhist faith in the country.

From 538 to 587, we see some conflicts between the 2 faiths.

* In 550, there's a pestilence blamed on angry kami, which results in Buddhist objects being destroyed.
* In 569, Soga no Iname is executed
* His son revives it and sends nuns to learn Buddhism

These nuns are important, because when they come back, they're treated so badly that the lines are drawn for battle.

#### Shotoku

At the Battle of Shigisan, Prince Shotoku, fighting for Buddhism, promises to erect a temple for the four heavenly kings if he wins the battle, pulls a Milvian Bridge, and builds a giant temple to commemorate his victory. There are more myths than facts about him:

* He was born able to speak, like the Buddha.
* He was born in a stable, like Jesus. (Japanese monks had met Christians in China)
* He could listen to multiple legal cases without error.
* He is made the regent after the battle of Shigisan.

Shotoku gives his aunt a new title using the newly invented kanji system, a title that will later become our modern title for "emperor". He goes on to do more things:

* In 603, he introduces the "cap-ranks system", so you know how much deference to show to who you're talking to. (This lives on in modern Japanese business cards.
* In 604, he introduces a constitution encouraging legality and morality, and says there can only be *one* ruler under heaven.
* In 607, he establishes ties to the Sui dyanasty. He calls Japan the "land of the rising sun" and China the "land of the setting sun" (This pissed the Sui off, but eventually succeeded)
* In 620, he compiles geneological lists of the Uji, taking the first step towards a national history.

Shotoku is supposed to have given his aunt three sutras:

##### The Lotus Sutra

This is the Buddhist version of the Sermon on the Mount, in which the Buddha says that he's said different things at different times to different people, but he will now tell the ultimate truth. Everyone will recieve enlightenment and everything is going to be OK.

##### The Vimalikitri Sutra

This sermon is actually given by a wise layperson, not a monk, and serves as a message to the priestly class that you can emulate the Buddha without being tonsured as a monk.

##### The Queen Srimala Sutra

In a court headed by a female ruler, this female delivered sermon was quite popular.

Shotoku eventually dies, but remains loved enough to be put on banknotes.

#### Handling the Dead

No more tombs are produced. Cremation becomes the norm.

#### Coexistence

Many Kami are regarded as Bodhisattvas, spirits who have attained enlightenment. Amaterasu and other major gods are bodhisattvas as well.
