# The Nara Period (710-794)

This period corresponds to the 8th century, and is the first period with a permanant capital. What's importand is the prevalance of Buddhism; this is a period where Buddhist clerics dominate the state. This leads to a backlash in which the state will later try to distance itself. This is when the legal code and national histories are compiled.

## Emperor Shomu (724-749)

Shomu was such a proponent of Buddhism he declared himself the servant of the Three Treasures of Buddhism. This is a huge deal, becaue he's the top dog in the Shinto faith. He's also the first emperor with Fujiwara blood. (Following the *Taika* coup, the Nakatomi get this surname)

### The 東大寺

Among his great achievements, Shomu builds the 東大寺, a massive Buddhist temple, containing a massive statue of *Vairocana*, an Indian Buddha who represents the body of the cosmos, believed by some Japanese to be Amaterasu. As a testament to religious enthusiasm, Shomu commits enormous amounts of new gold and labor to this enormous temple. The Daibutsu was formally inaugurated by painting in the eyes. You can still see the the legacy of this in Japanese politics. When politicians win, they paint in a Daruma's eyes. Priests from China, Korea, Iran, Champa in current day Vietnam and India all come to the ceremony, a surprising level of international contact.

## The *Manyoshu*

This period is known as the first period that produces Japanese poetry. In around 759, at the order of the court, a compilation of poems are written and distributed in the vernacular, not in Chinese. This is considered by some to be the peak of Japanese poetry, containing poetry by aristocrats, commoners and people from all walks of life and wealth, deeply connected to the seasons and nations.

## Kana

We have the Nara period to thank for saving us from even harder Kanji! This period gives rise to *Manyogana*, a precursor to the ひらがな of today that's extremley similar. Based of Chinese, and resembling Sanskrit, this script looks eerily similar to modern Japanese writing. カタカナ won't arrive for a while, for obvious reasons.

## *Gagaku*

This "elegant music" is our gateway to Asian music. During this time, it was prevalent across Asia. Currently, it only exists in Japan and has died out everywhere else. It's played on harps and zithers, and sounds [very strange](youtube.com/watch?v=rRFfyDE3gEo). Jesuits described this music as the "sqwaking of birds".

## The Clergy

* Shinto establishments are placed under Buddhist control, and there's a surprising amount of cooperation and understanding.
* National temples for every province are constructed at state expense.
* The emperor grants estates to the temples and private property begins to emerge.
* The clerics begin to recruit monks and nuns from the laity.
* Abusing clerics becomes super-illegal.
  * In 729, Prince Nagaya was accused by the Fujiwara (who didn't like him very much) of striking a monk. He was forced to commit seppuku.
  * In 764 Fujiwara no Nakamaro leads a rebellion against this practice.

## The 6 Nara Sects

* *Sanron* - Based on methaphysical texts
* *Jojitsu* - Based on metaphysical texts
* *Kegon* - Based on the Flowery Wreath Sutra, a massive text depicting the cosmos as a kind of interlocking mirrors. This sutra also mentions the "Internet Web". Sound familiar?
* *Kusha* - Based on the idea that the mind is the only real thing.
* *Hosso* - Extremley politically prevalent.
* *Ritsu* - Focuses on extremley strict monsastic rules.

These schools cooperate with only no fighting and work together. However, only the Kegon and Hosso acquire mass support.

## Emperor Koken

This female emperor rules for 9 years, abdicates in favor of hr cousin, and reascends after her cousin was exiled to Awaji Island. She's famous for her promotion of Buddhism, and her fondness for a priest named Dokyo. After curing her of an illness, Dokyo goes full Rasputin, and becomes her inseperable counselor. Histories don't paint him too favorably. Popular songs of the time went like this:

> *Don't be contemptuous of monks because of their robes,*  
> *For under their skirts are hung garters and hammers.*  
> *When hammers erect themselves,"*  
> *The monks turn out to be awesome lords!"*  

> *Straight at the root of the Bodhi tree*  
> *And you will find a venerable master standing,*  
> *Satiated and fat!*

Histories were just as nasty:

> *In 765, Dharma Master Dokyo of the Yuge had intercourse with the Empress on the same pillow, hearing the affairs of state and ruling over the country together.*

She declares her desire to transfer power to Dokyo and a theocracy of Buddhist clerics. A courtier named Wake no Kiyomaro goes to the shrine of Hachiman (Jingo's chiled) in Kyushu. (Both a powerful Kami and a Bodhisattva) He claims to recieve a vision. (Probably untrue) He claims to have heard that subjects cannot be made lords and that the wicked should be swept away. This proclamation was made by someone in the *same school* as Dokyo.

Koken dies in disgrace. During this time (592-770), Japan has enjoyed a rate of 30% female emperors, unheard of elsewhere. Koken s the last of these female emperor for almost 1,000 years.

## Emperor Kanmu

Reigning from 781 to 806, this emperor had an enormous desire to escape Nara. He moves the capital to Nagaoka for 10 years and then packs up and moves to...

### Heian

Laid out similar to Nara, this city that would later be renamed 京都 had temples far away from the palace so that Buddhism would not exert an overly powerful influence.
