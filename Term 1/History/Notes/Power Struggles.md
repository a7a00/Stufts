## Commiting Sudoku

This is technically still part of the samurai lecture, but we can't finish without talking about *seppuku*, the ritual of slicing your stomach open for an agonizing death. Samurai would often kill themselves to make a point or avoid a shameful death. After ripping your guts out, your second would often be on hand to chop your head off to end it for you. We find instances of *seppuku* as far back as the 10th century. In a military chronicle, a marked departure from the aristocratic world of the Heian, we read about the first major rebellion of the samurai.

### The *Masakado* Rebellion

We don't know exactly what happened, but we think that Taida Masakado tried to rebel against another family member while stationed in what is now Hitachi Prefecture. After being captured and pardoned, he tried to do it again. When he was captured a second time, the emperor ordered him to kill himself. The rebellion was later quashed by the Fujiwara, although there are doubts as to whether this was a rebellion, and it's possible he was taking on local corruption by the Fujiwara. We're not sure.

### Sumimoto

In the Narrow Sea between Honshu and Shikoku, there's a huge problem with piracy, which continues to impact China and Korea. In 941, pirate leader Sugimoto is killed by this method

## The Taira and the Minamoto

Fujiwara no Michinaga continues to claim the Minamoto as his "claws and teeth", but the Taira still has support in court. The 2 families fight a lot:

* In 1028, there's a Taira revolt in Kazusa, put down by the Minamoto.
* In 1051, the Nine Years war begins, in which the Minamoto squash the Taira again.
* In 1083, the Minamoto supress the Kiyohara clain in Mutsu.
* The Taira finally win in 1108.

The Heian courtiers don't really recognize this, but they begin to take notice when rude samurai are given positions at court.

## Warrior monks

*悪僧* first appear in 949 as demonstrators in Heian, protesting against an Imperial appointment to head to todaiji temple. They then become more involved:

* In 1035, Miidera warrior monks attack the *Enryakuji*, seat of their rivals.
* In 1039, *Enryakuji* monks set the Fujiwara regent's house on fire.
* In 1075, there's more fighting between these *Tendai* sects.
* In 1138, there's a massive fight in Kyoto.

> There are three things beyond Imperial control, the fall of the dice, the flow of the river Kamo, and the turbulent monks of Mt. Hiei.

## The 院せい

Emperors often would abdicate, leaving the Fujiwara to do all the work of leading the country and freeing the emperors time to lead the Japanese faith. However, in 1068, Go-Sanjou, an emperor who came to power without a Fujiwara mother and condemned by the Fujiwara as unfit to rule, symbolically turns down the Fujiwara regency and promptly abdicates in 1072 and establishes the 院せい as an office to see to the affairs of the imperial house. And by that, we mean land holding. As of the 11th century, the emperor doesn't really own anything, unlike his lord. Unlike in England, which had a monarch as its largest landowner, the Emperor relied on state coffers. After 1072 this changed and the emperors started gathering land. And more importantly, samurai.

So, recap:

* Up to 857, there is rule by an emperor.
* From 857 on, the Fujiwara call the shots.
* For a few decates, the new 院せい runs the show.

All right? Good.

## The Samurai Rise to Power

To understand this, we need to look at our friends the Taira and the Minamoto.

Taira | Minamoto
--------|----------
Tadamori | Tameyoshi
Kiyomori (son) | Yoshitomo (son)
 | Yoritomo (grandson)

### The Hougen Skirmish

For the first time in 1156, violence rocks Heian for the first time. In this year, there's a succession crisis. The reigning 院せい was named *Toba*. His chosen heir, Sutoku was forced to step down and power transfered to his younger brother, Konoe. After a short and controversial reign (he married his brother's wife), he kicks and we're left with a problem. Toba's wife had encouraged him to skip his middle son, Go-Shirakawa. Now that both other sons are dead, does Shirakawa finally rise to power, or does Sutoku's now mature son continue the line?

The Taira, led by Kiyomori, supports Shirakawa. The Minamoto family largely pledges to Sutoku's son, but there are some members who join the Taira.

#### Taira Kiyomori

After rising to power by supporting Shirakawa who (SPOILER ALERT) wins, he becomes the first warrior to become a senior noble. This will be important later.

### The Heiji Skirmish

After this Skirmish, Minamoto Yoshitomo, who had defected from his family to support Shirakawa is mad that Shirakawa isn't rewarding him for sacrificing so much for the new Emperor. So he joins with Fujiwara Nubuyori and mounts a 2 week rebellion in early 1159. Taira Kiyomori is absent from Kyoto (That's what it's starting to be called) on a pilgrimmage and they sieze the oppurtunity to kidnap the 院せい and force the young emperor Nijou to make Nobuyori chancellor. Kiyomori comes back, does battle and once again the Taira win. The two rebels commit seppuku.

### Yoshitomo's Sons

At the request of Kiyomori's mother, he spares the lives of Yoshitomo's sons:

* Minamoto Yoritomo is placed in the care of Houjou Tokimasa near what is now Kamakura. (not yet)
* Minamoto Noriyori is placed in the care of a Fujiwara official.
* Minamoto Yoshitsune is tonsured and raised as a priest.

These people will come back to haunt Taira Kiyomori later. Yoritomo ends up seducing Tokimasa's daughter and allying with his son. Not bad.

### The Genpei War

Japan's first nation-wide war begins when Yoritomo is asked to put down rebels and reinstall Taira authority. He and his new friends the Houjou  do the opposite, smashing the Taira power structure to bits. We'll talk more about this next time.

## The Arts

These are several forms of crossdressing theater, and Kiyomori has a love for the *Shirabyoushi* crossdressing women performers.

The Taira build an enormous shrine in the Inland Sea.

The Taira build an enormous temple full of statues of Kannon.
