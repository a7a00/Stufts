# The Heian Period

The Heian period is widely known for its literature, although there's a suspiciously large gap at the beginning of the period. There is one work between the *Kojiki* and the *Tale of Genji* that warrants particular mention.

## The *Nihon Ryoiki*

This book, written by a monk named Keikai, is a chronicle of Japanese miracles, as well as a hefty dose of the importance of fillial piety, respecting monks, respecting one's children and reciting sutras. This is an example of *setsuwa*, a collection of miscellaneous stories with a commen there. Some of the stories:

* *On a woman who loved pure ways, ate sacred herbs and flew to heaven.*
* *On mercilessly skinning a rabbit alive and recieving immediate penalty.*
* *On an orphan girl who prayed to a bronze statue and was recomensated.*
* *On a woman violated by a snake who survived due to the power of drugs.*
* *On a woman who gave birth to stones and honored them alive.*
* *On a girl born of a flesh ball who grew very large and had no chin.*

...The Japanese are weird. Anyhow, this text is massive, and the stories are very long, but what is very interesting is the presence of an enlightened woman. There's no piece of Buddhist literature like it in the world.

## Emperor Kanmu

As you remember, Kanmu moved the capital from Nara to Nagaoka, and then to Heian. Certainly one reason to transfer was fear of priestly interference, but it was essential to maintain legitimacy, and that means thaving the Buddhists on his side. He makes friends with two new sects, the *Shingon* and the *Tendai*, which we'll talk about in a few minutes.

### Saichou and the *Enryakuji*

The relationship with China is on course, but extremley rocky. The Japanese believed themselves to be on equal footing with the Chinese. The Chinese didn't like that at all, believing themselves to be the central kingdom. The Japanese are uncomfortable with this, but go through the motions. In 804, a large delegation is sent to trade with and study China. On board are 2 priests, Saichou and Kuukai. Saichou had originally come from China and was fiercly proud of that fact. He had become disillusioned by the corruption of the priesthood, as manifested by the Dokyo affair, and had established a sanctuary on Hiei Mountain. He had established this temple before the move to Heian, and when Kanmu makes the move, he finds himself at the best possible location. He gets on the mission to China, but his ship is blown off course. In south China, he immerses himself in the 天台 school, which studies the Lotus Sutra. As you remember, this sutra preaches that everyone will recieve enlightenment. It also emphasizes religious tolerance and diversity. Saichou then comes back from China with lot of writing and commentary and is reunited with Emperor Kanmu. Kanmu endows his temple, the *Enryakuji*. Over time, this temple grows so rich that it gets its own army of samurai. These samurai have the power to halt the business of the capital, cementing Buddhism's role in politics.

Saichou is rewarded for his efforts, founding a monastic community devoted to not interfering in politics and praying 24/7. Select men can visit, but not women, to keep desire out. (In fact, female tourists are still denied entry to some monastaries in Japan.) The most devoted monks pledge 25 years of their lives to teach and copy sutras on the mountain, never leaving. Another group goes out and performs community service such as masses and sermons. The largest section, surprisingly, was simply educated men who went out and acted as engineers and officials to help the state.

Saichou also took aim at a Nara custom. During the Nara period, all monks had to be ordained at a specific temple in Nara. After Kanmu's death, this privelege is extended to the *Enryakuji*, cementing the 天台 as the dominant Japanese school.

### Kuukai and the *Shingon*

Disillusioned with aristocratic life, this monk ranked ideologies in order:

* Animal conciousness, that primal awareness we share with animals.
* Confucianism, the difference between right and wrong.
* Daoism
* Brahmanism
* *Hinayana* Buddhism
* Various Mahayana schools
* The *Kegon* school is at the very top.

Kuukai actually makes it to Xi'an, and makes a very positive impression on the Chinese, and is chosen by the patriarch of the *Shenyan* school as his heir. This is a huge deal that a Chinese monk chooses a Japanese monk as his heir. Now, we don't know is the *Shenyan* is a big school or not, but we know it probably existed.

His school *Shingon* is based on *Vairocana*, the Buddha who represents the body of the cosmos. It's a very mystical school that emphasizes transforming your surroundings through what we call the 3 M's.

* *Mantras* - Recitations
* *Mudras* - Hand symbols
* *Mandalas* - Symbolic representations of the cosmos

He also kick-started Japanese psychoanalysis and is credited with being an all around genius. He was an incredible artist, an inventor of things from machines to ひらがな, a prolific writer, fluent in Sanskrit, you name it. Think of him as a Japanese Da Vinci. More interestingly, he also is considered the "patron saint" of Japanese homosexuality. The emperor makes a special exception, allowing hm to build the *東寺* within the walls of Heian. (A relativley poor part of it.) Once a year, people still approach his temple to selebrate his passing into a higher state of conciousness. He also builds a temple on Mount Kouya. In this environment, with lots of men and no women, we see controlled and articulated male homosexuality, complete with pledges, contracts, poems, and prayers to the Buddha. This becomes so ingrained within this temple that it's a common assumtion that Kuukai brought over the gay as a teaching from China.

## Visits to China

Following this mission, there are a few more missions to China before they're cancelled due to opposition. Meanwhile in China, opposition to Buddhism grows as Confucuanists label it as heresy and an enemy of the Chinese family. By the middle of the Haian perios, people don't like China at all. In *The Tale of Genji*, China is mocked as a backwards country while the Japanese cultural genius is celebrated.
