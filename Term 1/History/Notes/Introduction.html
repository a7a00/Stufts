<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-3">3</a> Avoiding Bias in Japanese History
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Japanese history itself has a history. We see a movement from glorifying it as part of the Orient (like, from the 1200’s on, people thought it was a fantasyland), to comparing it favorably to England after the Meiji Restoration. There’s a lot of history that glorifies it militarily after the Russo-Japanese war, and demonizes it in the 1930’s and then as a prime example of modernization, especially in the 1980’s. There hae been criticisms of this, though. Reischauer’s &ldquo;incipient capitalism&rdquo; theory says that we need to use Japan as a model for underdeveloped Asian nations, but this drive is really driven by capitalism.
