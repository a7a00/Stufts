\title{Homework 25: Power Series-Interval and Radius of Convergence}


\author{Alexander Gould, Section 3}

\maketitle
6. What is the radius of convergence of the power series $\sum c_{k}\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{k}$if
the radius of convergence of $\sum c_{k}x^{k}$ is $R$?

It would also be $R$, but it would occur at a different point, because
$c_{k}$ remains the same.

\textbf{Determine the radius and interval of convergence for the following.}

10. $\sum(-1)^{k}\frac{x^{k}}{5^{k}}$

The only time we get a real result here is between 5 and -5, so that's
the radius of convergence. The series diverges if $\left|x\right|>5$.

12. $\sum(-1)^{k}\frac{k(x-4)^{k}}{2^{k}}$

In this case $\left|2-\frac{x}{2}\right|<1$, or the series won't
converge, which means it only converges from 2 to 6, and diverges
otherwise.

13. $\sum\frac{k^{2}x^{2k}}{k!}$

$k!$ will always be greater than the numerator, which means that
we'llalways go to 0, which means an infinite radius of convergence
and an interval of convergence of all real numbers.

15. $\sum\frac{x^{2k+1}}{3^{k-1}}$

We know that the series converges between $-\sqrt{3}$ and $\sqrt{3}$,
thanks to the ratio test. Test it on either end, and find divergence,
so the radius of convergence is $\sqrt{3}$, and the series only converges
if $\left|x\right|<\sqrt{3}$.

18. $\sum\frac{(-2)^{k}(x+3)^{k}}{3^{k+1}}$

$2\left|x+3\right|<3$ if we want the series to converge, so that
means the radius of convergence is 2. Test the endpoints, and we find
that the interval of convergence goes from -5 to -1.

20. $\sum(-1)^{k}\frac{x^{3k}}{27^{k}}$

$\left|x\right|<3$ if we want the series to converge, so that means
the radius of convergence is 3. Test the endpoints, and we find that
the interval of convergence goes from -3 to 3.
