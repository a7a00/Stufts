# Propeties of Series

## Homework

For some reason, your dumb ass never does the right assignment! The homework due tomorow is Homework 17. SEVENTEEN. ONE, SEVEN. Lo entiendes? 分かるのか？ OK. Good.

## "Positive" series.

Suppose we have 2 postitive convergent series, ![1](../res/Lesson\ 1/1.gif) and ![2](../res/Lesson\ 1/2.gif). If C is any constant, ![1](../res/Lesson\ 1/1.gif) converges to the integral of the summed term ![3](../res/Lesson\ 1/3.gif). Secondly ![5](../res/Lesson\ 1/5.gif) converges to ![6](../res/Lesson\ 1/6.gif)

## The Divergence Test

The origin of this test is that if a series converges, then the sequence of terms has to go to 0. Makes sense. Since you're adding each new term, the values you add have to be getting smaller as you add them. We can take the contrapositive of this and say that if the sequence of terms doesn't go to 0, the sequence diverges. If not, well then you're SOL. Try something else. REMEMBER. Even if the sequence doesn't go to 0, that doesn't mean automatic convergence.

## Telescoping Series

It's easy enough to compress a geometric series into an equation and get the integral. But what do you do with an equation in open form? This is where the telescoping series comes in. :et's look at an example. It's written as ![7](../res/Lesson\ 1/7.gif), but when you expand it, you find that all of the terms cancel each other out! Think about it. My "i+1" is your "i", and they cancel each other out! We end up with the form ![8](../res/Lesson\ 1/8.gif), which means as we take the limit as ![9](../res/Lesson\ 1/9.gif), we just end up with 1! Will you look at that?

Let's try another one. ![10](../res/Lesson\ 1/10.gif) can be expanded, and when we canel out all the terms, we end up with ![11](../res/Lesson\ 1/11.gif). Take the limit as ![9](../res/Lesson\ 1/9.gif), and we end up with ![12](../res/Lesson\ 1/12.gif)! Hooray!
