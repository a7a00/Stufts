# The Ratio and Root Tests

We got a handout on this, so I'm not sure how much of these we're supposed to write down.

## The Ratio Test

We use this test mainly when there's a factorial.

Let ![1](../res/Lesson\ 3/1.gif). If ![2](../res/Lesson\ 3/2.gif) is between 0 and 1, we converge, if ![2](../res/Lesson\ 3/2.gif) is greater than 1, we diverge, and if ![2](../res/Lesson\ 3/2.gif) is 1, this system doesn't work.

Handy hint. ![3](../res/Lesson\ 3/3.gif).

### Example

Let's take ![4](../res/Lesson\ 3/4.gif). When we apply the test we find that ![5](../res/Lesson\ 3/5.gif). This simplifies to ![6](../res/Lesson\ 3/6.gif), which is less then 1, hence the series converges.

## The Root Test

Let ![7](../res/Lesson\ 3/7.gif). If ρ is between 0 and 1, we converge, if ρ is greater than 1, we diverge and if ρ is 1, this test doesn't work.

### Example

Let's take ![8](../res/Lesson\ 3/8.gif). We can apply the test and get ![9](../res/Lesson\ 3/9.gif), which is 1! Crap!  But, we can then use the divergence test to show that the series dinverges with a divergence test value of *e*.

### Another Example

Let's take ![10](../res/Lesson\ 3/10.gif) We use the Root Test and get ![11](../res/Lesson\ 3/11.gif). Done.

I tried to write the Root Test way of solving it, but there's no way I'm writing that down. The board is literally jammed with what looks like a liberal arts student's nightmare.
