# Introduction

Yay, this class is absolutley massive! And it looks fun! And you have to be a guinea pig for 6 hours to get credit! Woohoo! Anyway, on to the lesson.

## What is Cognitive Science?

Anything that involes interacting with human beings has some element of cognitive science. Neurological disorder study is based in this field, as is the reading in of human factors in law. It's vital in risk assessment, and of course is important for HCI. Also, this isn't a neurobiology course. Y'all ain't going to be doing neural networks. Or maybe we will... I got no idea, this lecture is jumping around. Basically this is the study of how your brain works as a computer.

Cognition is behind every AI problem. Ever.

* How do we recognize faces?
* How do we find Rt. 93?
* What do we remember and how do we prioritize it?
* How do you make huge decisions? (College, marriage, etc.)

## Levels of Representation

These are fundamental to any discussion of cognition. There are 3 levels at which we usually analyze information.

* Computational - What's the problem we have to solve?
* Algorithmic - How do we do it?
* Inplementational - How does your *brain* do it?

When trying to write algorithms, we run into a super common problem. Low level instructions are dumb as hell. THey understnad **nothing** outside what you tell them.

-FUCK MY LAPTOP IS DEAD. SHIT.-.
