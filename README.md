Stufts
======

Notes and projects from my first year of college. (Go Jumbos!) Mom wouldn't let me use my main GitHub. Grrr...

Inspired by the similar repositories belonging to [Zach Latta](https://github.com/zachlatta/school), [Krish Dholakiya](https://github.com/krrishd/school), and [Shreyas Raman](https://github.com/anubiann00b). If you're going to use this system, attribute them too, please!

#### Taking stuff from here

On Shreyas' recommendation, I'm using a slightly modified version of the [MIT License](LISCENSE.md).

My essays and projects (and code for CS classes) will be up here. If you want to use bits and pieces, that's fine, but please attribute it to this repo in your comments. I'll be making this repo citable for papers when stuff gets added. Until then, just cite it like a website.

#### About Japanese

LaTeX is being really freakin' difficult for some reason, so there might not be rendered PDF's of my Japanese and history notes until I fnd the root of the problem. In the meantime, look at the HTML files I exported instead.
