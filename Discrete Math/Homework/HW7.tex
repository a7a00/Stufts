\maketitle
1A. A function is only R to R if all elements of the range set are
real. The reciprocal of 0 is undefined.

1B. This function maps to the set of imaginary numbers for any number
less than 0.

1C. This function maps to 2 elements, negative and positive, for all
numbers.

3A. No. Multiple zeroes make the condition vague to only map to one
member of the range set.

3B. Yes. This will always be a unique value.

3C. No. There's no condition for a string of all 0's, making the function
undefined.

5A. Domain: all bit strings. Range: all integers.

5B. Domain: all bit strings. Range: all even integers.

5C. Domain: all bit strings. Range: all integers from 1 to 7.

5D. Domain: all integers. Range: all perfect squares.

7A. Domain: all possible pairs of integers. Ranga: all integers.

7B. Domain: all integers. Range: all integers from 0 to 9. (Not 10,
at least one number has to be there)

7C. Domain: all bit strings. Range: all integers.

7D. Domain: all bit strings. Range: all integers.

9A. 1

9B. 0

9C. 0

9D. -1

9E. 3

9F. -1

9G. 2

9H. 1

10A. Yes.

10B. No. 2 elements map to $b$.

10C. No. 2 elements map to $d$.

11A. Yes.

11B. No. No elements map to $a$.

11C. No. No elements map to to $a$.

12A. Yes.

12B. No. There are dupicates in the image set.

12C. Yes.

12D. Yes.

13A. Yes.

13B. Yes.
