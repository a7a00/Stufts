15. This will always be true by virtue of the second implication.

16. In order for the first expression to be true, P and Q must be
the same. The second side literally says, ``They are both TRUE, or
they are both FALSE.''

27. In a $\rightarrow$, either both are true, both are false, or
the first one is false and the second true. By including arrows going
both ways as conditions, you're making the arrow double headed.

31. The $p$ and $\neg p$ negate each other, leaving only $q\vee r$,
which is what's on the other side.
